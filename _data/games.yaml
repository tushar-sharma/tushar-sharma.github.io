  comments: "One of the best FPS games out there. The combat feels incredible—whether you’re on foot or piloting a Titan, every battle is pure adrenaline. The story builds up beautifully, and the ending is nothing short of spectacular. Cons: The EA launcher can be a bit annoying—it insists on connecting to the internet every time you launch the game on steam deck, and occasionally you’ll get a blank screen. A quick restart usually fixes it, though."
