- title: "Hades"

  comments: "It's a good rogue-like game. The combat rooms are procedurally generated. You get more powerful after you die. You can enable god mode which just increases your damage resistance by 2 percent every time you die till 80%."

- title: "Alan Wake2"
  rating: 4
  comments: "You need a GPU with mesh-shader support to run the game. The atmosphere is genuinely terrifying, and the cinematography in the cutscenes is top-tier. The Mind Place is a clever system for organizing clues and objectives. Combat can feel a bit clunky, though enabling One-Shot Mode helps smooth the experience. Exploration in dark areas occasionally drags, but the overall presentation is stunning. Abandoned."

  comments: "One of the best platformers ever made. Fantastic background music and smooth, fun gameplay. Note: Ubisoft launcher requires you to be online to start the game. The `Challenge mode` is no longer available on Steam due to Ubisoft server shutdown ([details](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/help/purchases-and-rewards/article/decommissioning-of-online-services-for-older-legacy-ubisoft-games-n-to-z/000105855))."

  comments: "One of the best FPS games out there. The combat feels incredible—whether you’re on foot or piloting a Titan, every battle is pure adrenaline. The story builds up beautifully, and the ending is nothing short of spectacular. Cons: The EA launcher can be a bit annoying—it insists on connecting to the internet every time you launch the game on steam deck, and occasionally you’ll get a blank screen. A quick restart usually fixes it, though."
