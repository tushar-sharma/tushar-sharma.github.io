<h3>Why hacking is good</h3>



  </p>

<p>Once a friend of mine asked if I could Hack. I asked him what he meant by hacking. Bemused at such a lame question he replied, &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know what hacking is?&#8221;. But I remained adamant &amp; asked him to explain himself. &#8220;Well hacking is, you know, to breach security &amp; steal passwords of sites like Facebook, etc&#8221;, he replied. I was crestfallen at the rampant misconception about hacking.</p>

<p>CERN has grabbed eyeballs around the globe. The notion of colliding nuclear particles at speed that of close to light is mind boggling. This has paved way for physicist to examine conditions that existed just around the Bing Bang. And the last puzzle to Standard Model Theory is Higgs Boson particle which is yet to be discovered. Higgs-Boson was coined God particle by a Noble laureate Leon Lederman. He nicknamed it so because as he states “it is so central to the state of physics today, so crucial to our understanding of the structure of matter, yet so elusive ”. But he later added “the publisher wouldn&#8217;t let us call it the Goddamn Particle, though that might be a more appropriate title, given its villainous nature and the expense it is causing ”. Many scientists dislike the term since even the discovery of Higgs-Boson would not answer some of the daunting problems in physics like Dark matter &amp; Dark energy which constitute more than 94% of our universe. Yet the media has made people to believe in awe of God particle.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s the media who feed the imagination of common man. Hacking itself is a victim of being misattributed to cracking. The culture of hacking emanated from the MIT where the term “hacking” resonated with creativity. Hacks was anything ingenious which may include any piece of code or even a prank. True hackers are those rare breed of people who are masterful programmers, network wizards &amp; believed in collaborating with others. They have built the community which has not only made the world wide web work but also made Linux OS what it is today. Linux is powering 70% of the internet &amp; all the supercomputers. Some of the famous hackers are Richard Stallman, Eric Raymond , Jamie Zawinski, etc. Another breed of programmers who are called crackers use their skills to write malicious code. These acts of intrusion caught the attention of the media. Rampant breach of security created a panic among public &amp; the intruder called them-self hackers which was promulgated by the the media. Not only did they rob people of their money but also condemned such a beautiful word as hacker.</p>

<p>Apple has its logo and so does Mircosoft. Hackers also have their own emblem. It&#8217;s glider, a pattern form Conway&#8217;s Game of Life.The philosophy of hacking is itself not confined to programming. The hacking culture embarks on the motto of sharing of information and helping the community. Wikipedia is Opensource and has been built around the culture of free software where free stands for free as if freedom. Andorid device which have flooded the the mobile market is also Opensource and has been built around Linux. Next time some body tells you about hacking facebook, correct him for his own good.</p>
