Dear Vishi, daily logs for May 28, 2025.

## Game Recommendation

If you like cozy games then probably try **The WereCleaner**. It's [free](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2795000/The_WereCleaner/) on Steam. You play as a janitor who needs to pay his rent. However you are also a warewolf who can eat people. Would recommend it. My only pet peeve is that it's too short.

## Student Visa ban

I woke up to the news that Trump administration has frozen student visa appointment for all US universities[^bbc]. Previously, US government had barred **Harvard University** to enroll foreign students, though this was overruled by the judge[^harward].
