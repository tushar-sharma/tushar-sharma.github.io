Dear Vishi, daily logs for May 28, 2025.

## Game Recommendation

If you like cozy games then probably try **The WereCleaner**. It's [free](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2795000/The_WereCleaner/) on Steam. You play as a janitor who needs to pay his rent. However you are also a warewolf who can eat people. Would recommend it. My only pet peeve is that it's too short.

## Student Visa ban

I woke up to the news that Trump administration has frozen student visa appointment for all US universities[^bbc]. Previously, US government had barred **Harvard University** to enroll foreign students, though this was overruled by the judge[^harward].

## Music would be the last feast I devour

Death is inevitable. I've been thinking that only a few are lucky enough to choose the right setting for their final breath. Imagine being killed suddenly in a car crash or an accident — robbed of the chance to fulfill your last wish. If fate were to cast its dice favorably for me, would I get to decide my own final wish? Whatever it might be, I know I wouldn't want to die in silence. I don't dream of a lavish meal before passing; instead, I want a playlist of my favorite songs. As I close my eyes, I would want the music to slowly fade away. Let me go with music playing in the background — that would be my last wish. Dying without music feels dull and cruel. Music would be the last feast I devour.
