## Gunnar Glasses

I accidently ordered glasses using my credit card. Since I have a doctor's prescription, I should have used HSA card.

There is a [contact page](https://gunnar.com/pages/contact) where you can cancel an order. Not sure if this would refund the amount . 

I also dropped an email to `support@gunnars.com`
