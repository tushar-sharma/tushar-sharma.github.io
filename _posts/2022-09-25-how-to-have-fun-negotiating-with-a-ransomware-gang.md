I stumbled upon a <a href="https://ig.ft.com/ransomware-game/">ransomware negotiation simulator</a> by Financial Times. It's a mock simulation where you're in a hot seat at a hacked company, trying to stop cybercriminals from releasing sensitive data they have stolen from your systems.

I stumbled upon a [ransomware negotiation simulator](https://ig.ft.com/ransomware-game/) by Financial Times. It's a mock simulation where you're in a hot seat at a hacked company, trying to stop cybercriminals from releasing sensitive data they have stolen from your systems.

So far I am not able to win negotiatons with the attackers. The FT says that the simulation is based upon interviews with real-life ransomware negotiators, and conversations with security researchers and company executives who have been on the sharp end of an attack. I guess it's a nightmare for any company to deal with breach of security.
