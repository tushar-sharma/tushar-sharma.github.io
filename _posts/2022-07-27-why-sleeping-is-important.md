It was 1'o clock in the morning. "I still got time to sleep", I said. The hand of clock pulled the time to 3'o clock and I havent' sleep. May be a little longer. And the unforgiving time announces it's 5'o clock in the morning. I have a meeting in the morning at 8. May be I shouldn't sleep.

These are some of the ludicrous decisions I often make. Next day is a complete disaster. I think sleep is very important. Even our bodies are tuned to need sleep like food. 

Not sleep has many deletr ious effect on heatlh.

I have realized that I cant compromise on my sleep. As we live in a capitalist society, people are forced to work more hours. However sacrificing sleep is counter productive. 

Also I am overweight and I have sleep apnea, so it's determinent for me to compromise on my sleep.
