  1. 1/3 of our lives we sleep. 
  
  
  1.  Next day you wake up and feel lethargic
  
  2.  If you are overweight, you might have sleep apnea, and your morning headaches will be bad. 
  
  3. Sleep may protect against Alzheimers [^alzhemirs][2]. Sleep helps in flushing out  beta-aamyloid from the brain which is a metabolic waste.
  
  4 . Researchers found that after 24 hours of sleep deprivation, a personâ€™s mental performance is equivalent to that of someone who has a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.10%, well over even the highest legal limit for driving in the United States (0.08%). So you shouldnt drive.
