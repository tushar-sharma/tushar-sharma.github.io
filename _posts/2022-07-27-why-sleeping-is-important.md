I have a confession to make. A confession pulled from the chancel of my heart. Occassionally I indulge in all-nighters. 

When I was in my 20s I rarely reflected how this would affect my health. However since I descended in my early 30s and have been betrayed by both my grey hair and slow metabolism, I thought I must pause and reflect how important sleep was. 
 
 
 
A confession pulled from the chancel of my heart. I have been guilty of countless of a sin. A sin that I must atone. As a young man, I unabashedly indulged in all-nighters.
  
 I am not longer a young man. My grey hair have betrayed my elixir of youth.  Our metabolism slows down by 10 percent every decade. And we continue to gain weight if we dont exercise regularly. Sleep apnea is common for people who are overweight. You experience morning headaches as your sleep nostils are partially blocked due to fat. 

 I am beginning to realize how important sleep is. We spent one third of our lives sleeping. Evolutionary speaking this dosn't make sense. Animals are suspectible to predators during sleep. Why life evolved to sleep despite the risks?
 
 Its seems like sleep is not at all futile. Infact if you dont sleep for 24 hours, your mental performance is equivalent of that of someone that has blood alcohol content(BAC) of .10%. In US, if you have BAC of 0.08% you can be arrested for DUI. So next time you pull all-nighters, dont drive. 
 
Also there's evidence that sleep protects in flusing out beta amyloid protein from the brain. This may protec against Alzheirmrs and dementia. 

It's just not sleeping but sound sleep which is impotant. Quality sleep is must. Unless you are attacked by aliens or facing an apoclapsye.
