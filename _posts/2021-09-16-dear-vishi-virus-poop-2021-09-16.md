<p>When the alarm clock breaks my slumber, I roll down on my bed, blindly crawling towards my alrarm clock as if it was a bomb in an effort to diffuse it. After multiple snoozes, I relenquish my dreams and come to my senses. Gulping water after I wake up is my first activity. Next I excuse myself to the bathroom for "nature call". All living things from a simple bacteria to a giant dinosaur needs to perform two basic life function; eat and excrete.</p>

Since our world has been ravaged by coronavirus pandemic lately, I wanted to discuss about viruses. As a child I often wondered, does the virus poop?.<!-- truncate_here -->

When the alarm clock breaks my slumber, I roll down on my bed, blindly crawling towards my alrarm clock as if it was a bomb in an effort to diffuse it.

Since our world has been ravaged by coronavirus pandemic lately, I wanted to discuss about viruses. As a child I often wondered, does the virus poop?

What's a virus? It's a bundle of genetic material (RNA or DNA) wrapped in a protein capsule called capsids. Virus seems to live a twin life; inside and outside of a host cell. 

Outside the host cell, viruses are at best not alive. They dont grow, reproduce, metabolize or maintain a constant internal temperature. They dont need nutrition and thus have no excretion. So viruses can't poop unlike bacteria. 

However something remarkable thing happens when a virus invades a host cell. It hijacks the cellular process to produce virally encoded protein that will replicate the virusâ€™s genetic material. So it does resemble a living entity. 

Due to this disparity, scientist often describe viruses as "organisms at the edge of life". 

Do virus die? Virus cannot die outside the host since they are not alive. However its capsid can degrades in the environment which ultimately makes the virus inactive. Inside our bodies, we have specialized T cells (white blood cells) that circulates looking for cells that are infected with viruses. Cytotoxic T cells kills cells that are infected with viruses. They recognize an antigenic peptide bounded to an infected cell.

Science has enabled humans to escape the  perilous life of the cave and settle into the human civilization. Most of the humans dont fear being devoured by a lion or attacked by rampaging elephant. However we now fear not the giant but the invisible minuscle microbes. The elemination of all diseases by microbes is still a far fletched dream.
