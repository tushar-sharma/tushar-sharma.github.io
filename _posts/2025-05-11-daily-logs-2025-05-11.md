Dear Vishi, daily logs for 11 May, 2025


## Running

I like running before lunch. Lunch is the first meal I usually have. I don't mind skipping the breakfast. Jokingly I call it intermittent fasting but I just not feel hungry enough. However if I miss running  prior to breakfast, I can't run in the evening.

## Steam Deck 

My steam deck has been booting slow lately. I've been installing too many non-steam games. I installed `CryptUtilities` and see if it improves performance in my steamdeck. 

[Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CryoByte33/steam-deck-utilities/main/InstallCryoUtilities.desktop) this link to your desktop (right click and save file) on your Steam Deck, remove the .download from the end of the file name, then double-click it.

This will install the program, create desktop icons, and create menu entries. Open `CryptUtilities` and apply all recommended settings.
