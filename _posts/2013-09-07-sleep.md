<p>As I lay on my cosy bed,<br> 
a hanging moon did my curtains lit,<br> 
under my pillow sank my weary head,<br> 
and slumber weaved its sleepy knit.<br>
</p>

The clock ticked and ticked away,<br> 
I climbed mountains and travelled like a bullet,<br> 
no laws of physics or Michael Faraday,<br> 
only in dreams can everyone shine like a starlet.<!-- truncate_here -->

As I lay on my cosy bed,<br> 
a hanging moon did my curtains lit,<br> 
under my pillow sank my weary head,<br> 
and slumber weaved its sleepy knit.<br>

The clock ticked and ticked away,<br> 
I climbed mountains and travelled like a bullet,<br> 
no laws of physics or Michael Faraday,<br> 
only in dreams can everyone shine like a starlet.<br>

Suddenly the window lost its shine,<br> 
the clouds caged away the moonlit night,<br> 
no breeze came to play the rhyme,<br> 
my dreams were wreaked by this monstrous plight.<br>

As my heart was pumping fast,<br> 
adrenaline but then a hand came past,<br> 
of my mother caressing my forehead and left,<br> 
the dark murky clouds away through the cleft.
