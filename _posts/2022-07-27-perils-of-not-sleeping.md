## The perils of not sleeping

I have a confession to make. A confession pulled from the chancel of my heart. It's not something that would invoke any ire of the law nor would it merit in getting any attention from society. It concerns me and me alone. It on of my vices in indulging in all-nighers.

Why can't I sleep ? Is it because I bingewatch Netflix? Or a nerve wrecking novel of Sherlocks Holmes arrested my sleep? May be I fathom about the purpose of life staring at the dark pit of hopelessness. Or may be the Capitalist society expects me to meet your work commitments?  

Either way, I rarely reflected on my sleep pattern on my 20s. However I grew tired of revolving aroudn the sun on my thirtieth birthday. The elix of youth was robbed of me. My grey hair and slow metabolism was a bad omen that made me to pause and reflect that I needed good sleep. \

Before I decide a good sleep pattern, I wanted to quelch my curiosity as to why we sleep. My forefathers were descendent from apes and lived in the savannah of the Africa. With such high evolutionary pressure to survice, I wonder why sleep has evolved to become almost a necessity. If you spend one third of your life sleeping, when would you find time to hunt for food and procreate. Also you are susceptible to predators during sleep. So there must be a very high evolutionary purpose of sleep to outweights all the risks. 

There are numerous studies on importance of sleep. Sleep helps flusing out beta amoloid from the brain. Accumulation small clusters of this protein may lead to dementia or Alzheirmrs disease. 

If you dont sleep  for 24 horus, your mental performance falls to that some who is intoxicated with alcohol with blood alcohol content (BACX) of .10%. In U.S, you can be arrested if you have BAC limit of more than 0.08%. So sleep deprived person is as impaired as a drunk person.

So how much should we sleep, I took this data from Natioanl Sleep Foundation


| Toddlers         | 11 and 14 hours 
| Children (3-5)  |  should get 10 to 13 hours
| children (6-13) | 11 
| teenagers       | 10 
| adults          | 7 to 9 years

I guess life is unpredictable. Sometimes we have to sacrifice sleep to finish work. However there's ample scientific evidence that throws light on the significance of sleep. We must strive to prioritize sleep as we prioritize food.
