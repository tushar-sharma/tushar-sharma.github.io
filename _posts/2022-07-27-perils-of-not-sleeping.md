## The perils of not sleeping

I have a confession to make. A confession pulled from the chancel of my heart. Occassionally I indulge in all-nighters. 

When I was in my 20s I rarely reflected how this would affect my health. However since I descended in my early 30s and have been betrayed by both my grey hair and slow metabolism, I thought I must pause and reflect how important sleep was. 

Why do we sleep? It doesn't make sense to me. For evolutionary purpose, it seems counter productive. Cro Magnans were more suspectible to predators during sleep. We spent almost one third of our lives sleeping. When I am hungry my stomach grumbles and when I sleepy I yawn and feel lethargic. So our bodies are designed to demand sleep. 
 
 Scientific evidence suggest that sleeps helps in flugins out beta amyloid protein from the brain. This is a metabolic waste. Accumulation of small clusters of beta amoloid may lead to dementia or Alzheimers. 
 
   
 
 Its seems like sleep is not at all futile. Infact if you dont sleep for 24 hours, your mental performance is equivalent of that of someone that has blood alcohol content(BAC) of .10%. In US, if you have BAC of 0.08% you can be arrested for DUI. So next time you pull all-nighters, dont drive. 
 
Also there's evidence that sleep protects in flusing out beta amyloid protein from the brain. This may protec against Alzheirmrs and dementia. 

It's just not sleeping but sound sleep which is impotant. Quality sleep is must. Unless you are attacked by aliens or facing an apoclapsye.
