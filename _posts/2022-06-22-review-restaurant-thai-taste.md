Today I visited Thai Taste located at 324 East Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28203. They probably had separate menu for each day. So today was Wednesday so that gave menu which said  Wednesday. Also the menu was one page and limited option. I asked for Pud Thai with tofu and vegetables. 

The food was okish. Not something that would make me come again. They also gave a soup in the beginning was was meh.

The price was around $15 without tip. Not worth it.

I wont be visiting this restaurnt again.
