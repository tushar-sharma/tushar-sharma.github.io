1. I always liked broccolli since childhood

2. Taste is subjective

3. I bought Phenylthiourea (PTC) Paper Strips and I taste nothing.

4. TAS2R38 gene encodes a serven-transmembrane G protien-copuled receptor that controls the ability to taste glucosinolates, a family of bitter-tasting compounds found in plants Brasssica.

5. TAS2R bitter receptors are thought to have evolved to detect toxins in plant and foods and to modulate ingestion of them.
