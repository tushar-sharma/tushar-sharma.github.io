## Stocks

One of the cool things I learned from my dad is how to use limit order while buying or selling stocks. Earlier I use to buy or sell stock at Market Order. This required extra efforts to track prices sometimes over days to find the optimum price. For instance I was tracking prices of [VTI](https://www.nyse.com/quote/ARCX:VTI) ETF. I wanted to buy the stock when it fell below $210. So I simply used a limit order to buy the stock when the price hit around $210. This limit order was opened for more than two weeks. So it saved me efforts to keep track of the stock price for two weeks.
