### Warts

It has been several months since I noticed warts on my toes. It's not paintful, but it look like a black dot.

Earlier I thoguht it would disappear on its own, but it has persisted. So I had to consult a doctor. Due to Covid-19 restriction, it's better to schedule a doctor appointment online. You pay doctor fee using [Google Pay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Pay). After the payment,  the doctor video calls you through WhatsApp. 

Salicyclic acid is the most often recommended against plantar warts. Earlier I was using Salicylix SF6 which contains 6% Salicyclic acid. The results were not satisfactory. 

Currently, the doctor has recommended to use Watnil Salalin lotion which contains 16.7% Salicyclic acid. I will update if this treatment is effective. The doctor also advised to take Zinc tablets to [boost immunity](https://www.ouh.nhs.uk/patient-guide/leaflets/files/14029Pzinc.pdf) against warts.

## Mixing Covid Vaccine

Earlier I was in dilemma if I should Covid vaccine in India or US. I am supposed to return to the US where I work on H1B visa. So I preferred to get vaccinated in USA where Pfizer vaccine has an efficacy of more than 90%. However due to unforseen event India was hit by second Covid wave and US suspended entry of people for large class of visa including H1B thanks to [Presendential Proclamation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/04/30/a-proclamation-on-the-suspension-of-entry-as-nonimmigrants-of-certain-additional-persons-who-pose-a-risk-of-transmitting-coronavirus-disease-2019/). It's not clear until when the presendial proclaimation will be revoked. 

So I've decided to get CovidShield (Oxford Vaccine) which I also taken by rest of my family. If the US banned is lifted eventually, I would take second dose of Pfizer vaccine. There are some preliminary studies that shows that mixing vaccine is safe.https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01359-3. However it's a not recommended to mix vaccine since more data needs to be examined. However I might take my chances if I flew back to USA. 

In the meantime, getting a first dose of vaccine in India is an uphill task. I am trying to find vaccination slots online for past two days yet with no luck. Most of the time either the cowin website doesnt responds or the slots are already booked. Hopefully I'll get my first coronavirus vaccine. At least its better to have some immunity than nothing.

## Stocks

One of the cool things I learned from my dad is how to use limit order while buying or selling stocks. Earlier I use to buy or sell stock at Market Order. This required extra efforts to track prices sometimes over days to find the optimum price. For instance I was tracking prices of [VTI](https://www.nyse.com/quote/ARCX:VTI) ETF. I wanted to buy the stock when it fell below $210. So I simply used a limit order to buy the stock when the price hit around $210. This limit order was opened for more than two weeks. So it saved me efforts to keep track of the stock price for two weeks.

## Code

### Poetry

I had a python project where I was trying to setup in a new laptop. I ran the following command

```bash
$ poetry install
```
My laptop has Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. 

```bash
$ poetry env info

Virtualenv
Python:         3.8.5
Implementation: CPython
Valid:          True

System
Platform: linux
OS:       posix
Python:   /usr

```

```bash
$ poetry --version
Poetry version 1.1.4
```

```bash
Creating virtualenv usa in /home/project/.venv                             
  ModuleNotFoundError                                                                             
  No module named 'virtualenv.seed.via_app_data'
  at <frozen importlib._bootstrap>:973 in _find_and_load_unlocked            
```

If you remove `python3-virtualenv` then `poetry` seems to work.

```bash
$ sudo apt remove --purge python3-virtualenv
```
