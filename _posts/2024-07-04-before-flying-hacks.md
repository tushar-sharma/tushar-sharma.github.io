Before Flying hacks.<!-- truncate_here -->


Before Flying hacks in airplane based on my personal experience.

## Ear pain

Chewing gum or sucking on ginger candy during takeoff and landing helps equalize pressure in your ears, preventing discomfort.  

## Seat Selection

Seats near the wings or at the front of the plane are closer to the aircraft's center of gravity, which can result in a smoother ride with less turbulence. Avoid seats at the back of the plane, where turbulence is typically felt more intensely.

However in an unlikely event of crash, back seats are statistically more safer than front seats.

##  Comfortable Clothing

Wear loose, comfortable clothing and layers to adapt to changing cabin temperatures. Compression socks can also help improve circulation and reduce the risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) on long flights.
