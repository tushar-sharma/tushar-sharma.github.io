## July 1

I always have jitters while flying. Saw a video of Air Europa Boeing 787-9 hit by severe turbulence.

How to survive air turbulence? 

* Use chewing gum if you have ear pain. It can help to counter the differences in air pressure and improve airplane ear symptoms

* Try ginger candy (preferably sugar free) for motion sickness
