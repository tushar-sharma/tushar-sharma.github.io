## Leetcode

### [Bulls and Cows](https://leetcode.com/problems/bulls-and-cows/description/) 

I solved the following leetcode problem.

```java
class Solution {
    public String getHint(String secret, String guess) {

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int numberOfBulls = 0;
        int numberOfCows = 0;
        Map<Character, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < secret.length(); i++) {
            char aSecret = secret.charAt(i);
            char aGuess = guess.charAt(i);

            if (aSecret == aGuess) {
                numberOfBulls++;
            } else {
                int aSecretValue = freq.getOrDefault(aSecret, 0);
                int aGuessValue = freq.getOrDefault(aGuess, 0);

                if (aSecretValue < 0) {
                    numberOfCows++;
                }

                if (aGuessValue > 0) {
                    numberOfCows++;
                }

                freq.put(aSecret, aSecretValue + 1);
                freq.put(aGuess, aGuessValue - 1);
            }
        }

        sb.append(numberOfBulls);
        sb.append("A");
        sb.append(numberOfCows);
        sb.append("B");

        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

`Esc` doesn't work for existing vim in microsoft universal foldable keyboard, instead type `Cltrl + '['`

My notes while reading the lecture slides, [introduction to java](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tcAkDu-vapQqUvW3p4qW8NO7DOm7RQq6/view?usp=share_link)

1. Use double instead of float. Provides too little precision and has few compelling case.

2. Minimize scope of local variables


```java
## More scope of i
int i;
for (i = 0; i < len; i++) {
}

## This is better
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
}
```

3. All non-prmiite are represented by objects

4. An object is bundle of state and behavior. State is data contained in the object. In Java, these are called its instance field. Behavior is the action supported by object. In Java, we call its method. Method is just OO-speak for function. "Invoke a method" is a OO-speak for "call a function".

5. All classes except Object have one parent class .

6. Inheritance: a class inherits visible fields and methods from its superclass. Can override methods to change thier behavior. Subtype can provide new implementation of superclass method (subtype polymorphism). Overriding method implementation must obey the contract of its superclass. Ensures subclass can be used anywhere superclass can. Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
