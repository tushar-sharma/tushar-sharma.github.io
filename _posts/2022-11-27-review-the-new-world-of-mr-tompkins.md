Review The New World of Mr. Tompkins

Mr Tompkins visits a public university to understand Eienstien's theory of relativity. 

In the lecture, he learns that the velocity of light is the maximum velocity in the universe. Also no material object can ever exceed that limit. 

Another interesting phenomenal is that when moving closer to velocity of light, measuring rulers contract and clocks slow down. However since velocity of light is 300,000 km/s, these relativistic effects could hardly be observed by ordinary life.

Mr Tompkins fell asleep and is dreaming about a fictious city where the maximum speed limit of light is 20 mph. So when Mr Tompkins sees a cyclist, he appear to him as flattened. When he begin chasing the cyclist, the streets grows shorters, but he and his cycle remain the same size and shape. 

Newton wrote in his book Principia wrote this about time

"Absolute, true, and mathematical time, of it self and from its own nature, flows equably without relation to anything external"

and this about space
