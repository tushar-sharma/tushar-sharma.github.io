Guide to Buying Sunscreen

When it comes to selecting sunscreen, the options might seem overwhelming. With an array of brands and SPF numbers on the shelves, it's essential to understand what these numbers mean and the importance of using sunscreen. Let's delve into the science behind it.

What is Sunscreen and Why Do We Need It?

Sunscreen is a product designed to protect our skin from the sun's harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays. These UV rays are a type of electromagnetic radiation emitted by the sun. While the visible light that we perceive with our eyes ranges from approximately 400 to 700 nanometers (nm) in wavelength, the sun also emits UV rays which fall outside of this visible spectrum.

Specifically, UV rays are categorized into two primary types based on their wavelengths:

UVA rays: These have wavelengths ranging from 315 to 400 nm. They are known for causing premature skin aging and potentially contributing to skin cancer.

UVB rays: These have wavelengths ranging from 280 to 315 nm. They are primarily responsible for sunburn and play a key role in the development of skin cancer.

Fun Fact: Bees can see ultraviolet light, a capability that humans lack. This ability helps them locate flowers and navigate.

Sunscreen works by incorporating active ingredients that either absorb, reflect, or scatter harmful UV rays, preventing them from penetrating the skin.

Understanding SPF

The term "SPF" stands for "Sun Protection Factor." Contrary to common misconceptions, the SPF number does not represent the percentage of UV protection. Instead, it indicates how much longer you can stay in the sun without getting sunburned compared to not wearing any sunscreen. For example, an SPF 15 sunscreen theoretically allows you to stay in the sun 15 times longer without getting burned.

However, the protection is not linear:

SPF 15 filters out about 93% of UVB rays
SPF 30 filters out about 97% of UVB rays
SPF 50 filters out about 98% of UVB rays
No sunscreen can block 100% of UV rays. While higher SPF sunscreens provide slightly better protection, the increase becomes marginal after a certain point.

Reef-Safe Sunscreens

With the increasing awareness of environmental concerns, many sunscreens now tout being "reef-safe." These sunscreens are formulated without oxybenzone and octinoxate, two common sunscreen ingredients that have been found to be harmful to coral reefs. If you're planning a trip to an area with coral reefs or want to make an eco-conscious choice, it's advisable to opt for a reef-safe sunscreen.

In Conclusion

When selecting a sunscreen, choose one that offers broad-spectrum protection (against both UVA and UVB rays), is water-resistant if you're engaging in water activities, and has an appropriate SPF for your skin type and activity level. Always remember to apply generously and reapply regularly, especially after swimming or sweating.
