Guide to buy a sunscreen

I always wondered which sunscreen to buy. There are lots of options. You walk into a shopping and there are plethora of brands with different SPF number.

First what's a sunscreen and why we need to use it. 

The suns is emitting sunlight which contains electromangnetic waves for all shorts of wavelength. The visible light we see with our eyes is only between range 200 to 400 nano meter. However sun is also emitting ultraviolet waves which have less wavelength in range between 100 to 200 nano meter.

> Fun fact: Bees can see ultraviolet light unlike humans.

Ok so sunscreen helps protect unltraviolet rays because its coating absorb UV rays. But what about these SFs number. 

SF number is about how much protection can these sunscreen provide. So a SPF of 15 means it has 15 percnet protection. 

So should you buy 100 SPF. Yes 100 SPF would protect against 100 % ultraviolet rays. 

What about Reef protected Sunscreen. 

If you are planning to visit coral reef, you need to buy Reef protected sunscreen so that it doesn't damage coral reef.
