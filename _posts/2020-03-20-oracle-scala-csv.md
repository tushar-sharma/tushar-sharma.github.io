I was looking to write a scala script to fetch large data from Oracle database. I was earlier using the Alteryx software to fetch data (around 1 million rows) from oracle which took around 7 minutes. Licensed softwares like Alteryx or Informatica, etc are great, but I was looking for a free solution.<!-- truncate_here -->


I was looking to write a scala script to fetch large data from Oracle database. I was earlier using the Alteryx software to fetch data (around 1 million rows) from oracle which took around 7 minutes. Licensed softwares like Alteryx or Informatica, etc are great, but I was looking for a free solution. 

We need ojdbc6.jar to connect to the Oracle 12 c database. We will create a Scala script to fetch data from the oracle database & save it to the output file (CSV format).


Lets create a simple function `timed` to time our execution

Now create  function `connOracle` to connect to Oracle

This took me *150  minutes* to fetch data 1 million records. That was not the performance I was looking for üòü

However I realized that I can increase JDBC performance by tweaking optimal fetch value. The default fetch size is 10 for JDBC. Since I have more than million rows in the database, I should increase the fetch size to 1000.

The execution time improved drastically  and reduced to approx *8 minutes*. 

Lastly it‚Äôs trivial to save the output to flat file (CSV format)

Also below is the `build.sbt` for resolving dependency 

```sh
name := ‚ÄúOracle Connection‚Äù
Version := ‚Äú0.1‚Äù
scalaVersion := ‚Äú2.12.4‚Äù

libraryDependencies += ‚Äúau.com.bytecode‚Äù % ‚Äúopencsv‚Äù % ‚Äú2.4‚Äù
```
