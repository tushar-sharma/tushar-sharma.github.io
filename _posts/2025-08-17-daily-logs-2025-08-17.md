## Porn and Sugar

I’ve started realizing how similar porn and sugar are. Both deliver that instant hit, that cheap thrill. But quit them? Life sharpens. They hijack your brain’s reward system—rewiring how you crave pleasure, the dopamine.

Sugar was my first victory. Brutal at the start. After a year clean, I tasted it again. That "rush"? Felt like poison. Made walking away easy.

Porn’s different. I still slip sometimes. It’s a corner to hide in—like a quick puff of smoke when stress hits. I’m not debating morals here. Just this: How do I ditch it for good? Zero lapses.

Science confirms porn’s damage: Studies show it shrinks brain areas linked to motivation and decision-making. And it’s everywhere—ubiquitous as oxygen.
