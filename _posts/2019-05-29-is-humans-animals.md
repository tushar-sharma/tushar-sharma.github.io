## Are humans animals? 

'are humans an animal', asked my fifth grade teacher. The class fell silent. I guess none of us considered ourself part of animals. I always had a notion of classifiying human separate from animal kingdom. Even Wallace, whose work along side Darwin, explained how organism evolved led his idea of human supremacy creep in this thesis.  But I guess nature disagree? 

Why do human share 95% of our DNA with mice ? why does medicine are testesd on mice if they are not remotely related to you. We share 98% of our DNA with apes. I have seen vidoes of apoes or orangatang exhibiting complex emotions. Such feelings is humbling. As darwing said, "man is at best a well shaved ape " 

But the idea of humans being animals is dismissed by religions. In all major religion in human history, man enjoys a special privileg , a favouritism with god. All other species are doomed to be inferior than him. He is the best of all species. 

If human is the best, then why humans are better than us . Cheetah can run faster than me. Snake can see infrared waves. bees can see ultriviolet waves. Bald eagle have wonderful eyesign. 

Not all of human body is junk. We have an amazing brains (largest known) relatvie to our size. OUr immune system is compelx and does well job. Our bones are harder than stell yet lighter. 

Yet we have design flaws. Why esophagus and trache pass close to each other. WHat aobut laryngeal nerve go craczy. why are arteries get clott. why we have inverse retina causing blind spot.
