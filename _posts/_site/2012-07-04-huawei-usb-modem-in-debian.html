<p>I&#8217;ll be using <code>wvdial</code> to configure the internet. It&#8217;s likely that your system will have the package pre installed. Otherwise you can manyally download it from <a target='_blank' href='http://packages.debian.org/squeeze/wvdial'>here</a>.</p>

<p>Now connect the modem and run lsusb to see the modem connected to the usb:</p>

<pre><code>$ lusub</code></pre>

<p><img alt='w4' src='/img/w4.png' /></p>

<p>Here we see Huawie usb is visible as Huawei Wireless Data Modem. Become a super user by typing <code>sudo su</code>. Now for detecting the modem run:</p>

<pre><code># wvdial /etc/wvdial.conf </code></pre>

<p><img alt='w1' src='/img/w1.png' /></p>

<p>This scans the usb port for modem. In my case the modem was detected in ttyUSB0. Now edit the wvdial.conf file. I am accustomed to use vi editor. But you can use any editor like gedit, nano, etc. Just replace vi with the name of your editor</p>

<pre><code># vi /etc/wvdial.conf</code></pre>

<p><img alt='w3' src='/img/w3.png' /></p>

<p>Remove the semicolons &amp; change the following values:</p>

<pre><code>Username: internet
Password: internet
Phone   : #777</code></pre>

<p>Also add the following lines to wvdial.conf</p>

<pre><code>Init3 = AT+CRM=1
Stupid Mode = 1</code></pre>

<p>Now run the following command.</p>

<pre><code># wvdial</code></pre>

<p>Bravo! It connects to the internet. Press <b>Ctrl + C</b> anytime to disconnect.</p>
