<p>Implemented encrypted files in Minix 3. The cipher used is simple Caesar&#8217;s cipher.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Implemented a new system call in Minix 3 along with the library function that allows it to be called conveniently from a C program. The library interface extends extends file access operations to handle encrypted files.</p>

<p>Reading and writing to a file is done through a system call. The first is to access the &#8220;master encryption table&#8221; file (/etc/encryptTable) that stores the information about every file that is encrypted within Minix and contains three pieces of information: fs_dev, inode_nr and hashed_pw. The first two information uniquely identifies what file is encrypted and can be obtained from the vnode for the file.</p>
