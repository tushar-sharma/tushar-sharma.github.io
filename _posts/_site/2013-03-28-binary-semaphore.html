<p>Implemented binary semaphore in Minix 3. Minix 3 is a micro-kernel operating system.</p>

<p><strong>About</strong></p>

<p>Most of the process pass information among themselves using application IPC. This often result in race condition. To prevent it and provide synchronization, semaphores, first proposed by Dikstras, is used.</p>

<p><strong>Description</strong></p>

<p>Implemented a new system call in Minix 3 along with the library function that allows it to be called conveniently from a C program. The library interface extends different process to use semaphore.</p>

<p>Binary Semaphore is used by processes to access the critical shared resources of the system. To demonstrate the working of semaphore, dining philosopher is implemented.</p>
