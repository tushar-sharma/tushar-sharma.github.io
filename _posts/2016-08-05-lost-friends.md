<p>Today I walked a little further, <br>
Few more steps than yesterday, <br>
For I love walking, <br>
And I have walked all my life. <br></p>

My walk is not straight, <br>
Often I stray from the path, <br>
Lost in thoughts of wilderness, <br>
Caged in the civilization of life. <br><!-- truncate_here -->

<p>Today I walked a little further, <br>
Few more steps than yesterday, <br>
For I love walking, <br>
And I have walked all my life. <br></p>

<p>My walk is not straight, <br>
Often I stray from the path, <br>
Lost in thoughts of wilderness, <br>
Caged in the civilization of life. <br></p>

<p>Today I walked a little further, <br>
Few more steps than yesterday, <br>
For the people that I have met, <br>
Mostly I have lost them in the way. <br></p> 

<p>Often I have a urge to pause,<br>
To glance over my shoulders,<br>
Only if my eyes could greet, <br>
Some old friend miles yonder. <br></p> 

<p>But the current of life seldom leaves,<br>
Footprints of yesteryears,<br>
And all those people I knew, <br>
Dissolved into the mist of memories. <br></p> 

<p>As the clock's hand marches ahead,<br>
And some of my grey hair do betray,<br>
Of those, lost friends and words unsaid, <br>
Will ever, the theatre of life, portray? <br></p>
