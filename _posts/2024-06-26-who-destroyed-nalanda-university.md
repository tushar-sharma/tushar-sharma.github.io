Nalanda University, located in present-day Bihar, India, was one of the most renowned centers of learning in the ancient world. Its destruction marks a significant loss to global intellectual heritage, but the question of who destroyed this great institution remains a subject of debate among historians and scholars.

Nalanda flourished as a Buddhist center of learning from the 5th century CE until its decline in the late 12th century. At its peak, it attracted scholars from across Asia and housed a vast library known as Dharmaganja or "Treasury of Truth."

Most left centric academia tends to blame the Brahmins. Here's a excerpt from the left-wing portal `thewire`<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> by Ram Puniyani, a current president of the Executive Council of the Centre for Study of Society and Secularism (CSSS) :

> All reliable sources point to the fact that Brahmins burnt the library as revenge. Bringing in Khilji fits into the general Islamophobic propaganda against Muslims and, at the same time, hides the true story of the persecution of Buddhists during that period.

How about a counter from a right-wing prespective. Here's an article published in `Swarajya` <sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> by Makarand Paranjape, a former professor at JNU university:

> But the old Nalanda was finished by Islamic invaders. Around 1200 CE, it was reportedly looted and burned by a local Turkic-Afghan chieftain-adventurer, Bakhtiyar Khilji. Legend has it that Khilji and his 18 horsemen went on to capture Bengal. So popular is this view that Al Mahmud, the Bangladeshi writer, not only reprises it in Bakhtiyarer Ghora (Bakhtiyarâ€™s Horses), but, some would argue, glorifies Khilji.

Interestingly Amartya Sen, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1998 and is also left-leaning, has this to say about Nalanda<sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup>: 

> Nalanda was violently destroyed in an Afghan attack, led by the ruthless conqueror, Bakhtiyar Khilji, in 1193, shortly after the beginning of Oxford University and shortly before the initiation of Cambridge.


So what's the truth? Was Nalanda university destoryed by Brahmins or Islamic invaders?

Whatever the truth may be about Nalanda's fall, it's crucial to remember that history should not be weaponized to settle present-day scores. Unlike science, where hypotheses can be tested through repeatable experiments, history is more susceptible to interpretation and inaccuracies. The past can offer valuable lessons, but an obsessive focus on historical grievances can be detrimental to societal progress.
