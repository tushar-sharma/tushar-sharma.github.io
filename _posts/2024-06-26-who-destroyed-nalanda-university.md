Who destroyed ancient Nalanda University in India? <!-- truncate_here -->

Who destroyed ancient Nalanda University in India?

Nalanda is considered centers of learning in the ancient world.

Most left centric views in India blames the Brahmins. Here's a excerpt from the left wing `thewire`<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> by Ram Puniyani, a current president of the Executive Council of the Centre for Study of Society and Secularism (CSSS) :

> All reliable sources point to the fact that Brahmins burnt the library as revenge. Bringing in Khilji fits into the general Islamophobic propaganda against Muslims and, at the same time, hides the true story of the persecution of Buddhists during that period.

It's good practice to read both right wing and left wings' views . Here's an article published in right wing magazine `Swarajya` <sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> by Makarand Paranjape, a former professor at JNU university:

> But the old Nalanda was finished by Islamic invaders. Around 1200 CE, it was reportedly looted and burned by a local Turkic-Afghan chieftain-adventurer, Bakhtiyar Khilji. Legend has it that Khilji and his 18 horsemen went on to capture Bengal. So popular is this view that Al Mahmud, the Bangladeshi writer, not only reprises it in Bakhtiyarer Ghora (Bakhtiyarâ€™s Horses), but, some would argue, glorifies Khilji.

Interestingly Amartya Sen, who won the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1998, has this to say about Nalanda<sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup>: 

> Nalanda was violently destroyed in an Afghan attack, led by the ruthless conqueror, Bakhtiyar Khilji, in 1193, shortly after the beginning of Oxford University and shortly before the initiation of Cambridge. 


So what's the truth? Was Nalanda university destoryed by Brahmins or Islamic invaders?
