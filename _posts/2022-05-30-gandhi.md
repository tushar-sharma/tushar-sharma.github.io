Currently I am reading Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi. 

## Advice to a Congress Worker, Devipur, Feb 17, 1947

A grand reception has been arranged for Gandhiji. The village was decorated with flags, buntings, steamers and garland of yarn. It jarred on Gandhiji. 

His words, 

"I wouldn't have felt so hurt if, instead of floral decoartions, you had presented me with garlands of yarn. They are decorative, and afterwards can be used for making cloth also. So nothing is wasted. It seems there is a lot of money in this village. Otherwise you would never have thought of making such costly ephemeral garlands in these hard times."
