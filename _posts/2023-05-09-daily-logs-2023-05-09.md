> "It is the unknown around the corner that turns my wheels" - Heinz Stucke

I went for cycling today. It was after my evening meetings like 9ish. The streets of dehradun gets desolate after 9pm. Barring any security concerns, I believe night is the best time to ride a bike in India. You are sparred the hurly burly of daytime.
