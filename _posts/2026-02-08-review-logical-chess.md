## Game 1 - von Scheve - Teichmann

The chief object of all opening strategy is to get the pieces out quickly. **e4** is an excellent opening move. Next move if allowed is **d4**. The two pawns will then control the four squares on the fifth squares.

Black must contest the centre immediately.

Why all this stress on the centre? Why is it so important? Pieces placed in the centre enjoy the greatest freedom of action and have the widest scope for their attacking powers.

- white moves **e4** 

- black moves **e5**

- white moves **Nf3**. This makes a threat to black's pawn. Precept : Knight before bishop.

- How does black protect his pawn? **2..f6** is terrible because it blocks queen's path. 

- black moves **2..Nc6**.

- white moves **Bc4**. This attacks blacks **f7** pawn. This pawn is vulnerable because it's guarded by only one i.e. king.

-  black also moves **Bc5**. This also attacks the white's pawn which is most vulnerable.

- white moves **c3**. 

- black moves **2..Nf6**

- white moves **d4**

- black moves **exd4**

- white moves **cxd4**. This would allow the white to place central pawns. 

We can prevent this 

- black can move **Qe7** after white moves **c3**

- If White persists in playing 5 d4, the continuation 5…exd4 6 cxd4 Qxe4+ wins a pawn.
