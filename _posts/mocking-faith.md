When I was waiting for bus when a person walked to me. He had a flyer which he handed to me. he asked me if i die today, where am I going, "heaven or hell". I was littel taken a back. I was hungry and probably hoping to munch some good food and this guy was forecasting my death. I said i'll just die. I dont believe in heaven.

He said if i dont convert to his religion, I will be burning in hell. I asked him you belong to this religion so hopefully you are going to heaven. He said I hope. So there's no garaunteee. Anyways i said. If you are going to hevaen, why do you want more peop;le to go there. You will be happy to lvie here. more people means more crowded.

He said no brother i realdly care about you. So you care about me what happens to me when I die.

He said yes.

If you care about me so much how about you give me some money in this life and i will remember this kindness when i go to heaven with you. he said he cant give money to me.

of course you wont give monty to me. because i am not body to you . then why do you care i convert to youru religon.
