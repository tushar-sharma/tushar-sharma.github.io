Dear Vishi, dear logs for today.

## Modifying in Spring Data

We use **Modifying** annotation in Spring Data to indicate that query will modify the database (e.g. INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). By default, queries in Spring Data JPA are read-only. 

```java
@Entity // it means it's mapped to a table
@Table  // this is optional
public class Employee {
    @Id
    private Long id;

    @Column(name = "is_deleted")
    private boolean isDeleted = false;
}
```

```java
@Repository
public interface EmployeeRepository extends R2DBCCrudRepository<Employee, Long> {
    @Modifying
    @Query("UPDATE employee e set e.isDeleted = true where e.id=:id")
    int softDeleteEmployee(@Param("id") Long id);
}
```
