The json-api server runs on port 7575. you can ssh into the pod and run this command to check it's working correctly. 

```bash
curl http://localhost:7575/v2/version
TODO : post output
```

one way is to expose this port 7575 outside the pod.  other opttion is to use spring gatway and access this port using `8080` port

first modify scg.yaml

```
```
