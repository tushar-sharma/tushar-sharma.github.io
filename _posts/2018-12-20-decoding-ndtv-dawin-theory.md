I wanted to decode an old debate that saw on ndtv. It was about a controversy erupted by the comments of a junior Indian education minister, Satyapal Singh. He is India's Minister of State for Human Resource Development. He had claimed that evolution is "scientifically wrong" becaue he never "<b>saw an ape turning into human being</b>". <!-- truncate_here -->

How does he claim evolution is "scientifically wrong"? Does the said minister have a degree in biology or published a paper that can be peer reviewed? On the contrary he served as the Police Commisioner of Mumbai. So does he understand how science works? 

#### What is science 

Probably someone wearing a white garb while looking streanously into the microsope.

The debate begis with the following members viz,
1. Das Ratan Nigam (a lawyer & also a member of RSS)
2. Ankit Sule,  doctorate in Asotphysics
3. Chandra Sharma, professor of education at IGNOUS
4. Two young students

I wander why there was no evolutionary biologist invited to the panel while discussing evolution. It's like debating about a law without inviting any lawyers. I would love to hear the defense of "evolution" by biologist like Richard Dawkins or Amitabh Joshi (in Indian context). Here's a link to speech on evolution[2] by Amitabh Joshi.

RSS is an Indian right wing organisation. So it's usualy predictable that right wingers usually oppose "evolution" since it embarrases their relgious beliefs. Religion always give anthromorphic view of the world where human deserve a pedastal higher than rest of the animals. While with evolution, there's nothign special about humans, just another species that branched from last universal commmon ancestor.In the United States, many right wings religous group often opposed "evolution" to being taught in school.[us]

Das Ratan Nigam is lawyer by profession & is affliated to RSS. He is known to espouse pseudoscietific theories likes that of P.N. Oak who claimed that both Christaniy & Islam were derivatives of Hinduism and that Vatican City, Kaaba, Westminster Abbey and the Taj Mahal were once Hindu temples of Shiva. His petition to rewrite history has been dismissed by the Indian Supreme court[court].


In 1:19 minutes of the video, Das Ratan says the minsiter Saytapal Singh is only challenging Darwins's theory of evolution. He says that there are muliple theories of evolution. But he didn't elaborate on what other theories of evolutions he was alluding to. May be he meant botanist Carolus Linnaeu's theory who based his categorization of species on theory of unchanging life created by God. Or George Louis Leclerc who believed that Earth was only 75,000 year old & men descendent from apes. Or Does he believe in Genesis or tales of Hiranyagarbha (golden embryo) mentioned in the Rig Vedas?

However he makes a straw man fallacy by claiming that Darwin himself didn't belive in his theory as there was lack of fossil evidence. When confronted by the anchor that fossil evidence has beenfound, he retorts that "no fossil evidence has come for the incomplete species". This argument has always been used in popular media to discredit evolution. But missing link is now considered a non-scientific term. Copied verbatim from wikipedia

<blockquote>
The term "missing link" has fallen out of favor with biologists because it implies the evolutionary process is a linear phenomenon and that forms originate consecutively in a chain. Instead, last common ancestor is preferred since this does not have the connotation of a linear evolution, as evolution is a branching process.
<blockquote>

Here's a speech by Richard Dawkin on "missing link"[3]

He babbles that evolution taught today is Neo Darwanism which has nothing to do Darwin's theory of evolution. He confuses Modern Synthetic theory with Neo Darwanism. Neo Darwainism is the interpretation of Darwanian evolution by incorporating Mendelian genetics. However the theory still on the Darwin's idea of "natural selection".

Ras Ratan Nigam continues to discredit evolution by claiming that Darwing had no clue for genetic mutation. This is similar arguemnt to reject Newtonian physics by claiming that Newton had no idea about space time continuum or that mass increase with velocity or space is not infinite. Newton's idea was revolutionary in understanding laws of gravity. Einstien realised that Newton's theory of gravity was not comlete which eventually gave birth to "theory of relativity". Darwin didn't know much about DNA or nucleotide. He was also wrong about heredity due to blending (later it's found to be particulate). Yet his idea of natural selection which lays the foundation for modern evolution theory. People opposing evolution howver never suggest alterantive thoery that is both falsifiable & verifiable. 
 

In 3:48 minutes of the video, anchor ask Chandra Sharma about his views on evolution. He deplomatically says that the minister has only raised question on evolution. He said that it's valid that we must more research on evolution. He says that the Indian misister quoted scientist and books that discredit evolution. He somehow slips into Vishnu (India god) claiming that ancient India books contained much more knowledge. This is a slipper slope becaues many people claim that their holy anicent books contains scientific wisdom. It might be true sometimes, but often it leads into maze of psedo scientific claims. 

In 7:21 minutes of the video, Das Ratan Nigam said that a Noble laureate Fred Hoyle doesn't belive in evolution. This is argument ad populum often used by people to say that a proposition is true because "If a smart scientist belive so". However he doesn't understand scientific consensus. 

How do we know evolution is true? It's because of "scientfic consensus". It's the collective judgment, position, and opinion of community of scientists in a particular field. Newton was a brilliant physicist who postulated laws of gravity. However he also belived in alchemy. There is no "scientific consensus" that alchemy is valid. Kurt Wise is also a smart man who holds a PhD in paleontology from Harvard University. He belives that earth is literary less than 10,000 year old. However there is "scietific consensus" that earth is a 4.5 billion year old. So it doesn't matter if a particular scientist holds a fringe belief which is often touted by religious people to promulgate their beliefs. 

The only sane voice I found was that of Ankit Sule. He had started the petition[pet]addressed to the minister Mr Singh and was signed by over 5000 scientist from India and abroad. In 9:53, we must look & study ancient Indain science but opposes every modern theory and trying to find it in ancient scriptures.

In parliamnet , BJP MP said that cow dung and cow urnie could cure cancer. The misister Mr. Singh had also earlier talked of ancient airplanes in ancient india. Such claims are made by all religious people. Somebody has found big bang in quran. Or photoelectic effect in BIble. Or speed of light in hanuman sholkas. 

Ofcourse it doesn't mean that there is no wisdom in ancient scriputres. Shustuta had a treatise in surgery or Paigal in grammar. And people accross the globe.  Yet to calim credit and save their scriptuure, relgious people someitmes stoop to defy the obvious empiracle fact as evolution.
