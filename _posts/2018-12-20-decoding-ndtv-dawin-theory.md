The ndtv debate [1] over comments made by junior Indian minister Satyapal Singh  on evolution. He said that evolution is 'scientifically wrong' because he claims that no one ever 'saw an ape turning into human being'

The members of the show were viz,
1. Das Ratan Nigam (a lawyer & also a member of RSS)
2. Ankit Sule,  doctorate in Asotphysics
3. Chandra Sharma, professor of education at IGNOUS
4. Two students

I wander why there was no Indian evolutionary biologist invited when discussing evolution. It's like debating about a law without inviting any lawyer. I would love to hear from biologist like Richard Dawkins or Amitabh Joshi in Indian context. Here's a link to speech on evolution[2] by Amitabh Joshi.

In 1:19, Das Ratan says the minsiter Saytapal Singh is only challenging Darwins's theory of evolution. He says that there are muliple theories of evolution. But he didn't elaborate on what other theories of evolutions he was alluding to. May be he meant botanist Carolus Linnaeu's theory who based his categorization of species on theory of unchanging life created by God. Or George Louis Leclerc who believed that Earth was only 75,000 year old & men descendent from apes. Or Does he believe in Genesis or the Hiranyagarbha (golden embryo) mentioned in the Rig Vedas?

Ras Ratan Nigam goes on the say that Darwi himself didn't belive in his theory as there was lack of fossil evidence. When confronted by the anchor that fossil evidence has been indeed found, he says that "no fossil evidence has come for the incomplete species". This argument has always been used in popular media to discredit evolution. But missing link is now considered asa non-scientific term. Copied verbatim from wikipedia

<blockquote>
The term “missing link” has fallen out of favor with biologists because it implies the evolutionary process is a linear phenomenon and that forms originate consecutively in a chain. Instead, last common ancestor is preferred since this does not have the connotation of a linear evolution, as evolution is a branching process.
<blockquote>

Ras Ratan Nigam is a lawyer by profession.  I wonder if he really understan evolution. May be he could do himself a favor by listening to Richard Dawkin rejecting missing link[3]. He goes on to say that evolution taught today is Neo Darwanism which has nothing to do Darwin's theory of evolution. He confuses Modern Synthetic theory with Neo Darwanism. Neo Darwainism is the interpretation of Darwanian evolution by incorporating Mendelian genetics. Neo Darwanism still hinges on the Darwin's idea of "natural selection".

Ras Ratan Nigam continues attacink evolution by claiming that Darwing had no clue for genetic mutation. This is similar if someone rejected Newtonian physics by claiming that Newton had no idea about space time continuum or that mass increase with velocity. Though not perfect, yet Netwon's idea was revolutionary in understanding laws of gravity. Darwin didn't know about DNA or nucleotide. He was also wrong about heredity due to blending (later it's found to be particulate). However it is his idea of natural selection which lays the foundation for modern evolution theory. People are often vigorous in criticizing the flaws of theory of evolution. Yet they never suggest any other valid theory that could rival theory of evoltion.

In 3:48, Chandra Sharma about his views on evolution. He deplomatically says that the minister has only raised question on evolution. He said that it's valid that we must more research on evolution. He has a Masters in Science, M.Ed, M.Phil and Doctoral degree in Education from University of Delhi. So it' no surprirse that he not aware of the on going research already in field of evolutionary biology.
