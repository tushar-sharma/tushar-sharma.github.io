## Cooking

I made vermicelli today. Here's the recipe 

1. Saute onion, garlic, tomatoes with salt and other spices.

2. Pour water and vermicelli and cover the lid and let it rest for some time (I forgot to count how much time).

3. Cut coriander and garnish it

## Panera

I ate dinner at Panera. I liked that they have pick up two option.I had tomato soup and half chipotle chicken sandwitch.



## Git 

Git status shows untracked files. Sometime we want to avoid that. 

```bash
$ git config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
```
