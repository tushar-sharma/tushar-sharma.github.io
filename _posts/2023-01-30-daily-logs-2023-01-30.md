Dear Vishi, this is my daily log for Jan 30, 2023.

## Cooking

I made vermicelli today. Here's the recipe 

1. Saute onion, garlic, tomatoes with salt and other spices.

2. Pour water and vermicelli and cover the lid and let it rest for some time (I forgot to count how much time).

3. Cut coriander and garnish it.

## Panera

I ate dinner at Panera. I liked that they have pick up two option.I had tomato soup and half chipotle chicken sandwitch.


## Git 

Git status command also shows untracked files. Sometime it's too much clutter. Hide untracked files 

```bash
$ git config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
```

## Node vs NPM 

Node.js is JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Check node version as

```bash
$ node -v
```
NPM(Node Package Manager) is a package manager for Node.js that helps manage packages and dependencies for a Node.js project. Check npm version as

```bash
$ npm -v
```

## Unable to find valid certification path to requested target

I got this error in Spring boot while making a GET request to bitbucket. First got to bitbucket website.

Click on lock icon left of url bar. Connection is secure -> Certificate is valid -> Details -> Export to download SSL certificate file.

```bash
$ sudo keytool --import -alias spring.cer -file $filename -keystore $JAVA_HOME/lib/security/cacerts
```

Then it will ask for keystore password which is `changeit`.
