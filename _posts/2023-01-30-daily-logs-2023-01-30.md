## Cooking

I made vermicelli today. Here's the recipe 

1. Saute onion, garlic, tomatoes with salt and other spices.

2. Pour water and vermicelli and cover the lid and let it rest for some time (I forgot to count how much time).

3. Cut coriander and garnish it.

## Panera

I ate dinner at Panera. I liked that they have pick up two option.I had tomato soup and half chipotle chicken sandwitch.


## Git 

Git status command also shows untracked files. Sometime it's too much clutter. Hide untracked files 

```bash
$ git config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
```

## Node vs NPM 

Node.js is JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a browser. Check node version as

```bash
$ node -v
```
NPM(Node Package Manager) is a package manager for Node.js that helps manage packages and dependencies for a Node.js project. Check npm version as

```bash
$ npm -v
```
