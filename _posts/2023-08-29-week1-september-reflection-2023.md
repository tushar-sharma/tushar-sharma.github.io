### English

Learnt a new proverb, "one swallow doesn't make a summer". It means that a single event or occurrence does not necessarily indicate a trend or a larger pattern. 

### Spanish

¿Dónde vives? It means where do you live. Of course vive would mean "I live". So, Yo vivo en Charlotte. This means I live in Charlotte. However if I have to say: I am from India, then I can say, "Soy de India".
