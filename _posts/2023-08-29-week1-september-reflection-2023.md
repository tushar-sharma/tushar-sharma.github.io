## Things I learned this week

### English

One swallow doesn't make a summer. It means that a single event or occurrence does not necessarily indicate a trend or a larger pattern. 

Shoot the breeze. It means to have a informal conversations. 

### Spanish

¿Dónde vives? It means where do you live. Of course vive would mean "I live". So, Yo vivo en Charlotte. This means I live in Charlotte. However if I have to say: I am from India, then I can say, "Soy de India". 

### Signals in Angular

### Open Telemetry Introduction with Zipkins

### Create dependency tree with Maven

### Thursday Ping Pong league

### On Jinnah

Interesting thing I learned about Jinnah is that he never went to jail. Also he never wrote a book. According to Ishtiaq Ahmed[^ham], he also enjoyed pork sausages. 

In contrast, Nehru, Gandhi and even Savarkar wrote book and went to jail. I find left in India often demonizes Savarkar. The RSS/BJP ecosystem lampoons Nehru. I guess both attacks are unwarranted. Both went to jail protesting against the British. 

There is an old controversy in India regarding Jinnah's portrait at Aligarh Muslim University. Left leaning [The Wire](https://thewire.in/history/aligarh-muslim-university-jinnah-portrait) defended the portrait instead stating that: The AMU portrait of Jinnah must not go. If anything, we need thousands more. A good question is is there a trend to remove portraits of controversial people. Portrait of Nobel laureate, [Aung San Suu Kyi ](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/sep/29/oxford-college-removes-painting-of-aung-san-suu-kyi-from-display) was removed from Oxford after worseing conflict in Myanamar. Statues of Lenin were destroyed in Ukraine after the fall of Soviet Union.

## What do do after an accident in the United States

This is the first time I have to deal with accident in the U.S. so I wanted to document everything. First thing to do during the accident is take pictures of your car from all side. Also take picture of the other's car from all sides. 

Next step is to get number of any witeness or someone who saw the accident. This would be helpful. If accident is fatal and the person is not accepting the fault, then it would be prudent to call the 911. 

The goal is to get the insurance policy number from the other person. You dont want to call your own insurance company else your monthly rate would go up. Instead ideally we want the other person's insurance to pay for the damage. 

When you call the other person's agent, he will call you and tell you that your call is recorded. You can decline this and ask him to send these questions on email. I didn't know this as he is trying to find fault in your line of thoughts.

Next is you need to upload live photos throught their app and wait for the claim.
