## Things I learned this week

### English

Learnt a new proverb, "one swallow doesn't make a summer". It means that a single event or occurrence does not necessarily indicate a trend or a larger pattern. 

### Spanish

¿Dónde vives? It means where do you live. Of course vive would mean "I live". So, Yo vivo en Charlotte. This means I live in Charlotte. However if I have to say: I am from India, then I can say, "Soy de India". 

### Signals in Angular

### Open Telemetry Introduction with Zipkins

### Jinnah

Interesting thing I learned about Jinnah is that he never went to jail. Also he never wrote a book.According to Ishtiaq Ahmed [^ham], he also enjoyed pork sausages. 

 In contrast, Nehru, Gandhi and even Savarkar wrote book and went to jail. I find left in India often demonizes Savarkar. The RSS/BJP ecosystem lampoons Nehru. I guess both of unwarranted. Both went to jail against the British. Of course you can cherry pick events or speeches to criticize either one of 'em.
