Visit to Los Zapatos Viejos

As I wandered through the vibrant streets of Cartagena, a city where every corner whispers tales of history and culture, I found myself drawn to one of its most quirky and lesser-known attractions: the Old Shoes Monument, locally known as Los Zapatos Viejos.

This peculiar monument, tucked away in a serene part of the city, away from the bustling tourist paths, is more than just a pair of oversized, weathered bronze shoes. It's a symbol of the resilience and enduring spirit of the people of Cartagena. The shoes are modeled after the ones worn by the beloved Colombian poet, Luis Carlos LÃ³pez, known for his humble and relatable style of writing.
