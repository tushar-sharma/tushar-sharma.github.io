TypeScript Enums and String Mapping

In a world of typescript, type safety is a king. Enumerations (enums) provide a way to define a set of named constants, ensuring more readable and less error-prone code. 

Lets define a enum in typescript

```
enum Answer {
  No = 0,
  Yes = 1,
}

enum Status {
    Approved = 'APPROVED',
    Pending = 'PENDING'
}

```
