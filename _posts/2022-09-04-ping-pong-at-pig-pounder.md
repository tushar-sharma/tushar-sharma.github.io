I was looking for a company to play ping pong. I found a table tennis meetup at Pig Pound Brewery at Greensboro, North Carolina. I drove hundred miles from Charlotte to reach the place which is a testimony to the fact that I really like the sport.

The brewery has a nice pig graffiti on their walls. It has two table tennis table kind of close to each other which left less room for maneuvering. One table was occupied by kids. We were left with only one table to play.

There was also a live music event at the venue by Banjo Earth. Interestingly, one the singer of the band visited Kashmir, India and composed the song, Nights in Kashmir.
