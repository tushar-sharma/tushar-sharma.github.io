### In the news

I woke with the news that Supreme Court of US has overturned Roe vs Wade judgement. This essentially means that abortion is not protected legal right in US anymore. Lot of conservative US states like Arizona was declared withing hours after the judgement that all abortion is illegal. Many other conservative States are likely to follow similar suit.


I believe that for thousands of years men have been making laws on behalf of women. So it's essential that women have this debate among themselves and woman politicans have veto over male potlicians. Personally I am pro choice. I dont belive pro life are actually a misnomer. They are pro birth and have scant regard for the child once he/she is born.
