Dear Vishi, daily logs for 9 May, 2025

## Proton Error

I have non-steam game, Lonely Mountains Snow Rider, installed on my steam deck. I use **Proton Experimental** in Compatiblity. However today, I got the **Assertion failed** error while opening it

{% template  customCode.html %}

id: 0f49c69c7a57a8551865cbcefaa2b019
file: error.log
---
{% endtemplate %}

Solution is to use another previous Proton version like `Proton 9.0-4`. 

## FilePart with doOnNext

I am currently working on a problem where I have a **service**, which calls another API for inserting files

{% template  customCode.html %}

id: 0f49c69c7a57a8551865cbcefaa2b019
file: FilePartService.java
---
{% endtemplate %}

This works fine, however the client will take time while the external API is inserting file. However I wanted to return a **202** status instantly and execute the external api as a `side effect`. Something like this


{% template  customCode.html %}
---
id: 0f49c69c7a57a8551865cbcefaa2b019
file: FilePartServiceSideEffect.java
---
{% endtemplate %}

However this fail with `java.nio.file.NoSuchFileException` as the publisher is already closed the stream while the `doOnnext` is executed. **FilePart** loses the files it stored temporary. I am still working for a better solution.

## Fix Alan Wake 2 Resolution

I am playing **Alan Wake 2** on steam deck. I bought [docking station](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CR6JND4M) to connect it to the TV. However the resolution was broken as it launched a tiny, unchangeable window.

Solution is to delete **Proton Prefix** and restart the game. However this deletes the saved game. 

{% template  customCode.html %}

id: 0f49c69c7a57a8551865cbcefaa2b019
file: stream.sh
---
{% endtemplate %}

This will force the game to regenerate fresh `renderer.ini` and all other config files.

## Papers, Please

I am playing `Papers, Please`. I got arrested by Supervisor on Day 26. Solution is to reload Day 25 , either approve or deny her entry. Don't detain her.
