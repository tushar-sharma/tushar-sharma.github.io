## Why India passport is weak?

1. I travelled to Mexico. Booked Air candada airline. Connecting flight was from Toronto. I had Mexican visa. No Canada visa. I cant board connecting flight withotu transit visa.

2. Some countries require transit visa for connecting flight. even if you dont leave the airport. Rich passport are exempted. 


3. Amit Shah made a remark that Indias passport ranking has improved under Modi. In his words, now when you travel to other countries, border agent smiles when he look at your passport and says that you are from Modi' country". Never seen such behaviror . In fact, according to Hensley our ranking is still very poor.
