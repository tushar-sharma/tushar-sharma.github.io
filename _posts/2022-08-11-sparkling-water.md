I was pleasently surprised to stumble upon sparkling water. It's water infused with CO2. Chilled sparkling water is pleasantly taste good. 

I have some concerns with drinking carbonated water. They are

1. It might have adverse effect on enamel 

2. There might be some loss of calcium

3. Acidity in stomach.
