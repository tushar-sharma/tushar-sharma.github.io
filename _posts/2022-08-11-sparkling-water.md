According to American Heart Association (AHA), human body does not need any additional sugar to function healthily. So I basicaly try to avoid sugar infused soft drinks. I was pleasently surprised to stumble upon sparkling water. 

Sparkling water is the carbonated water which means that it's infused with carbondioxide under pressure. My first reaction was isn't CO2 bad? 

We can write a simple chemical equation like
 
CO2(aq) + H2O(l) ⇌ H+(aq) + HCO3–(aq)

The ph of carbonated water is 3-4 (acidic). 

Few questions I still have regarding sparkling water

1. Does it effect enamel ?

2. Is there loss of calcium ? 

3. Will there be acidity in the stomach ? 


It's definately better alternative than soft drinks. However there's still not enough evidence to conclusively suggest that sparkling watrer has any adverse effects. I guess moderation in anything is the mantra.
