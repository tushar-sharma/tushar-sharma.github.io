## Week 3, Aug 2023 Reflection

### Food

I bought P.F. Chang's Chicken Lo Mein from Food lion. It was frozen and I probably not going to purchase it again. The only frozen noodles that I liked were Ajinomoto Vegetable Yakisoba from costco. But I dont have costco membership anymore.

### Video Games

I am enjoying playing Fifa 19. I mostly play Journey mode. I enjoy shuffling between three characters.
