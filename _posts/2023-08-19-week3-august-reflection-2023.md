Dear Vishi, this is third weekly reflection for Aug, 2023.

### Picking a stock

It's been months since I bought any stocks. Recently I sold `$SAIC` stock. But picking a stocks is a tedious process for me. I want to invest in stock or ETF this month.

First I calculate `moving average` for each stocks and generate a [report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11WyMo0tQX6McQNdktcvpav30tlZSJg7p/view?usp=sharing).

Another filter I try use is to pick stocks with dividend. Even if the stocks plummet in its value, you can still grow your portfolios by `reinvesting dividend`.

Lets first look at `$cme` stock. 

### Commute to office

It takes me almost 30 minutes to reach to office. Most of the time I am stuck at morning traffic. I have few options how to utilitze this time while on car

1. Call home (talk to parents at Indian time)

2. Listen to music.

3. Listen to audiobooks or a podcast.

4. Watch a movie.

5. Listen to pink/white noise.

6. Learn spanish.

Watching a movie always make me nervous as it may not be legal to watch while driving. Even audiobooks distracts me. I have sleep apnea so I don't like talking to anyone in the morning. If I was commuting on a train, I would probably add reading. So it boils down to these choices. 

1. Listen to music. 

2. Listen to pink/white noise. 

3. Learn Spanish.

### Food

I bought P.F. Chang's Chicken Lo Mein from Food lion. It was frozen and I probably not going to purchase it again. The only frozen noodles that I liked so far were Ajinomoto Vegetable Yakisoba from costco. But I dont have costco membership anymore.

I also ate at following resturants this week (I would probably would go bankrupt spending money on food): 

1. Chipotle: Bowl with no rice, both beans, chicken, fajitas, tomatoes, corn, guac, no lettuce.

2. Panera: Buy two option. Baja Bowl (extra avacado) with tomato soup.

3. Taco Bell: Power menu bowl with chicken and black bean chalupa supreme.

4. Tikka Shack: Spinach Masala with extra veggies and rice.

5. Ilios crafted greek: Chicken Sandwitch with beet salad.

6. Chick-fil-A: Grilled sandwitch wtih Cobb salad. I really liked Charred Tomato Crispy Red Bell Peppers.


### Video Games

I am enjoying playing Fifa 19. I mostly play Journey mode. I enjoy shuffling between three characters. Also playing soccer with controller is much more fun compare to shooting game.

### Car Registration Renew

I had to renew my car registration [online](https://payments.ncdot.gov/). Earlier I also did a car state inspection from Firestone. I was bummed when Firestone told me that my car inspection can only pass if I replace my beam wiper blade for \\$53. I don't know if they charged me legit this was really required or they duped me into buyting it. But I acquiesced as I really wanted leave that place after waiting for more than two hours. State Inspection cost me \\$30 with labor.

### Pratice against ping pong robot

There's a ping pong robot at Table tennis club, Charlotte. It's fun to pratice against it. However I am not seeing any improvement in my game. Last Thursday's league game, I had the worst performance.  I had few nice serves but made too many **unforced errors**. 

### Badminton

I have resumed playing Badminton at Marion Diehl Recreation Center and Pool. The timings are 7pm to 9pm on Wednesday.

### Tennis

I am trying to improve my backend return. I had a an hour coaching with Zack in Huntersville for tennis for $50. He showed me how to use a backhand properly. I am still trying to improve it.

### ESPP contribution

An employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) is a company-run program in which participating employees can purchase company stock at a discounted price.

I have contributed 7% of my paycheck. I will need to read more about it to understand more.

### Programming
