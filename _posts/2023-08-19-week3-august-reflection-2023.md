## Week 3, Aug 2023 Reflection

### Food

I bought P.F. Chang's Chicken Lo Mein from Food lion. It was frozen and I probably not going to purchase it again. The only frozen noodles that I liked were Ajinomoto Vegetable Yakisoba from costco. But I dont have costco membership anymore.

### Video Games

I am enjoying playing Fifa 19. I mostly play Journey mode. I enjoy shuffling between three characters. Also playing soccer with controller is much more fun compare to shooting game.

### Car Registration Renew

I had to renew my car registration [online](https://payments.ncdot.gov/). Earlier I also did a car state inspection from Firestone. I was bummed when Firestone told me that my car inspection can only pass if I replace my beam wiper blade for $53. I didn't if this was really required or they duped me into buyting it. But I acquiesced as I really wanted leave that place after waiting for more than two hours. State Inspection cost me $30 with labor.
