Dear Vishi, this is third weekly reflection for Aug, 2023.


### Food

I bought P.F. Chang's Chicken Lo Mein from Food lion. It was frozen and I probably not going to purchase it again. The only frozen noodles that I liked so far were Ajinomoto Vegetable Yakisoba from costco. But I dont have costco membership anymore.

I also ate at following resturants this week (I would probably would go bankrupt spending money on food): 

1. Chipotle: Bowl with no rice, both beans, chicken, fajitas, tomatoes, corn, guac, no lettuce.

2. Panera: Buy two option. Baja Bowl (extra avacado) with tomato soup.

3. Taco Bell: Power menu bowl with chicken and black bean chalupa supreme.

4. Tikka Shack: Spinach Masala with extra veggies and rice.

5. Ilios crafted greek: Chicken Sandwitch with beet salad.


### Video Games

I am enjoying playing Fifa 19. I mostly play Journey mode. I enjoy shuffling between three characters. Also playing soccer with controller is much more fun compare to shooting game.

### Car Registration Renew

I had to renew my car registration [online](https://payments.ncdot.gov/). Earlier I also did a car state inspection from Firestone. I was bummed when Firestone told me that my car inspection can only pass if I replace my beam wiper blade for \\$53. I don't know if they charged me legit this was really required or they duped me into buyting it. But I acquiesced as I really wanted leave that place after waiting for more than two hours. State Inspection cost me \\$30 with labor.

### Pratice against ping pong robot

There's a ping pong robot at Table tennis club, Charlotte. It's fun to pratice against it. However I am not seeing any improvement in my game. Last Thursday's league game, I had the worst performance.  I had few nice serves but made too many **unforced errors**. 

### Badminton

I have resumed playing Badminton at Marion Diehl Recreation Center and Pool. The timings are 7pm to 9pm on Wednesday.

### Tennis

I am trying to improve my backend return. I had a an hour coaching with Zack in Huntersville for tennis for $50. He showed me how to use a backhand properly. I am still trying to improve it.
