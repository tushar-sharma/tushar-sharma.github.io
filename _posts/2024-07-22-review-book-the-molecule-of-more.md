Dopamine. What's dopamine? It's a molecule secreated by part of brain. Often dubbed pleasure molecule, it's presumed to be released when we experience pleasures. However this book explores how dopamine is a molecule of more not just pleasure. Like the author said the dopamine activity is not a marker of pleasure. It's a reaction to the unexpected - to possibility and anticipation

> Love is a need, a craving, a drive to seek's life greatest prize

I like this quote. I guess we all need love to have a meaningful life. 

The pathway to dopamine in the brain is called reward circuit. It reminds me of Pavlov dog. Ringing of a bell caused him to salivate. Was that releasing dopamine in his brain?

One problem with dopamine excitement is that it doesn't last forever. That's if you need to do something new to get more release of dopamine. Example if you like a dish so much, dopamine will be released in your brain. If you have the same delcious dish everyday, dopamine would stop releasing for the same dish.

>  Dopamine has a very specific job: maximizing resources that will be available to us in the future; the pursuit of better things

I guess doesn't that makes dopamine drives us to get better. So can we equate dopamine with motivation? Are they different?

>  If you live under a bridge, dopamine makes you want a tent. If you live in a tent, dopmaine makes you want a house. If you live in the most expensive mansion in the world, dopmaine makes you want a castle on the moon. Dopmaine has no standard for good, and seeks no finish line. The dopmaine circuits in the brain can be stimulated only by the possiblity of whatever is shiny and new, never mind how perfect things are at the moment. The dopamine motto is "More"

So dopamine makes you desire more but is never statisfied. You can't rely on dopamine alone to find happiness in our daily life.

>  Vasopressin acted like a "good-husband harmone". Dopamine does the opposite. Human beings who have genes that produces high levels of dopamine have the highest number of sexual partners and the lowest age of first sexual intercourse.


> Just as dopamine is the molecule of obsessive yearning, the chemicals mostly associated with long-term relationships are oxytocin and vasopressin. Oxytocin is more active in women and vasopressin in menj. 

What's vasopressin? Is it a hormone or a molecule? If you hypothetically inject vasopressin in a promiscous male, would he change behavior? Are there any any food that promotes vasopressin? 

> Endorphins (your brain's version of morphine), and a class of chemicals called endocannabinoids (your brains' version of marijuana). As opposed to the please of anticipation via dopamine, these chemicals give us pleasure from sensation and emotion. In fact, one of the endocannabinoid molecule is called anandamide, named after a Sanskrit word that means joy, bliss, and delight.

So if I release more endorphins in my body, will I get the same feeling as high on morphine?

> Under more normal conditions, though, dopamine activation in the desire circuit triggers energy, enthusiasm, and hope. It feels good In fact, some people spend the majority of their lives pursuing this feeling - a feeling of anticipation, a feeling that life is about to get better.

But isn't what we call hope? A janitor does his job diligently in a hope that he would save money and get better job in future.

> the future isn't real. It's made up of bundle of possibilities that exist only in our minds. Those possibilities tend to be idealized - we usually don't imagine a mediocre outcome.

> What happens when the future becomes the present - when the dineer is in your mouth or your lover is in your arms? The feeling of excitement, enthusiasm, and energy dissipate. Dopamine has shut down. Dopamine circuits doen't process experience in the rela world, only imaginary future possibilities.

So we need something else to keep feeling good after we achieve our goals?
