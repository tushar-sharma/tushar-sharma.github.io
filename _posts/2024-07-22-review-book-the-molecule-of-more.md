What's a dopamine? It's a molecule secreated by part of brain. Often dubbed pleasure molecule, it's presumed to be released when we experience pleasures. However this book explores how dopamine is a molecule of more not just pleasure. Like the author said the dopamine activity is not a marker of pleasure. It's a reaction to the unexpected - to possibility and anticipation

> Love is a need, a craving, a drive to seek's life greatest prize

The pathway to dopamine in the brain is called **reward circuit**. It reminds me of Pavlov dog. Ringing of a bell caused him to salivate. Did dog released dopamine at the sound of the bell?

One problem with dopamine excitement is that it doesn't last forever. That's if you need to do something new to get more release of dopamine. Example if you like a dish so much, dopamine will be released in your brain. If you have the same delcious dish everyday, dopamine would stop releasing for the same dish.

>  Dopamine has a very specific job: maximizing resources that will be available to us in the future; the pursuit of better things

I guess doesn't that makes dopamine drives us to get better. So can we equate dopamine with motivation? Are they different?

>  If you live under a bridge, dopamine makes you want a tent. If you live in a tent, dopmaine makes you want a house. If you live in the most expensive mansion in the world, dopmaine makes you want a castle on the moon. Dopmaine has no standard for good, and seeks no finish line. The dopmaine circuits in the brain can be stimulated only by the possiblity of whatever is shiny and new, never mind how perfect things are at the moment. The dopamine motto is "More"

So dopamine makes you desire more but is never statisfied. You can't rely on dopamine alone to find happiness in our daily life.

>  Vasopressin acted like a "good-husband harmone". Dopamine does the opposite. Human beings who have genes that produces high levels of dopamine have the highest number of sexual partners and the lowest age of first sexual intercourse....Just as dopamine is the molecule of obsessive yearning, the chemicals mostly associated with long-term relationships are oxytocin and vasopressin. Oxytocin is more active in women and vasopressin in menj. 

What's vasopressin? It's a molecule like dopmaine. It's a primarily acts as a hormone. What's a hormone? They are chemical messengers that are released by a gland and is released into the bloodstream. They travel to different parts of body to regularte various physiological processes like growth, metabolism and mood. Hormones influence the functions of the body’s cells by binding to large proteins known as receptors, whose shape and electrical charge interact with one particular hormone. When a hormone binds to its receptor protein, it causes a change in the receptor’s shape that triggers changes within the cell. So a molecule can be a hormone. But not all molecules can act as a hormone. What about proteins? Proteins are a complex molecule and can also act as a hormone. E.g. Insulin regulates blood sugar levels.  

If you hypothetically inject vasopressin in a promiscous male, would he change behavior? Are there any any food that promotes vasopressin? 

> Endorphins (your brain's version of morphine), and a class of chemicals called endocannabinoids (your brains' version of marijuana). As opposed to the please of anticipation via dopamine, these chemicals give us pleasure from sensation and emotion. In fact, one of the endocannabinoid molecule is called anandamide, named after a Sanskrit word that means joy, bliss, and delight.

So if I release more endorphins in my body, will I get the same feeling as high on morphine?

> Under more normal conditions, though, dopamine activation in the desire circuit triggers energy, enthusiasm, and hope. It feels good In fact, some people spend the majority of their lives pursuing this feeling - a feeling of anticipation, a feeling that life is about to get better.

But isn't what we call hope? A janitor does his job diligently in a hope that he would save money and get better job in future.

> the future isn't real. It's made up of bundle of possibilities that exist only in our minds. Those possibilities tend to be idealized - we usually don't imagine a mediocre outcome.

> What happens when the future becomes the present - when the dinner is in your mouth or your lover is in your arms? The feeling of excitement, enthusiasm, and energy dissipate. Dopamine has shut down. Dopamine circuits doen't process experience in the rela world, only imaginary future possibilities.

So we need something else to keep feeling good after we achieve our goals?

> In the early 1960s, doctors prescribed large amounts of dopamine-boosting amphetamine to promote "cheerfullness, mental alertness, and optimisim"

ADHD = Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder. People with ADHD have poor focus, less concentration and more impulsive. 

> They may start pyaing bills, then switch to doing the laundry, then change a light bulb, then site down and watch TV with everything strewn all over the place...not listen to what people say to them. Sometimes they don't keep track of time, making them late, and they may lose things, such as car keys, call phones, even passports.


ADHD is ofen seen on children because their frontal lobes which control dopamine acts, develop last and do not fully connect to the rest of the brain until a person finishes adolescence and enters adulthood. Can we say that frontal lobes in the brain control dopamine acts? Dopamine is produced in other parts of brain and it affects frontal lobes which is responsible for highly cognitive functions like decisions making.

Frontal lobes are the last parts of brain to fully develop which might be in mid-20s. That's why teenagers are impulsive.
