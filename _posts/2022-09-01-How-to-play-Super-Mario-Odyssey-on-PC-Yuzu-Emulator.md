Super Mario Odyssey is a 2017 video game has been voted as the one of the best Mario game ever made. The game is only available for Nitendo Switch. Luckily I end up playing the game on Windows nonetheless.

We need to download [yuzu](https://yuzu-emu.org/downloads/) emulator. Follow the instructions to install it on Windows. First download and install Microsoft Visual C++ redistributable. Next download `yuzu_install.exe`.

> If you get error, yuzu encryption keys are missing. <br><br>
> Fix: Download the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icosaswitch/Yuzu-NAND/master/prod.keys">prod</a> file.<br><br> 
> On Yuzu Windows -> Go to File -> Open Yuzu folder <br><br>
> Save the file under `keys` folder.


Download the game below. Open `yuzu` emulator  and click on plus sign (Add new Game directory). Navigate to the game directory.

If you don't have joystick, you might want to configure keyboard with `yuzu` emulator. Download [input.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IwMqMr8E0L_crNhhaWnYqSShTCqliRN8/view?usp=sharing). Extract the `zip` file under `Yuzu -> config -> input` folder.

You can got `Emulation -> configure -> Control` and see the connect controller indicated in green color.

You can launch the game by clicking the game icon.
