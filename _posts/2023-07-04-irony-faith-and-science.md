As we gaze into the dark sky, captivated by the sparkling stars, we often find ourselves contemplating the deeper meaning of life and the existence of a higher power. The question of whether God is a mere human construct or if our existence holds merit in the vast realm of the universe remains an enduring and thought-provoking debate. While science does not provide definitive proof for or against the existence of God, examining the beliefs of renowned scientists can shed light on the diverse perspectives that coexist within the scientific community.


### A vegetarian and an atheist

Srinivasa Ramanujan was a brilliant mathematician from India. His contribution earned him fellowships at Trinity College and the Royal Society. However he was also a devout Hindu and a vegetarian. He believed Hindu goddess, Namagiri, whispered mathematical truths in his dream.

> "An equation for me has no meaning, unless it expresses a thought of God" ― Srinivasa Ramanujan

However his mentor, G. H. Hardy, was an atheist. He often refused to enter a chapel even for funerals or for elections of college officials. However he colloborated with Ramanujan in mathematics and cherished his friendship.

> "Well, I have done one the thing you could never, have done, and that is to have collaborated with both Littlewood and Ramanujan on something like equal terms." - G. H. Hardy, A Mathematician’s Apology


### Co recepient of Standard Model's Nobel prize

Abdus Salam won Nobel prize in physics for his contribution to Standard Model. When asked about his inspiration, Salam acknowledged his religious beliefs, illustrating how his faith provided the impetus for his scientific inquiries. 

> "The Holy Quran enjoins us to reflect on the verities of Allah’s created laws of nature; however, that our generation has been privileged to glimpse a part of His design is a bounty and a grace for which I render thanks with a humble heart." - Abdus Salam, Address to UNESCO (1979)

In stark contrast, his co-recipient, Stephen Weinberg, an avowed atheist, expressed a sense of hopelessness upon gazing into the vastness of the cosmos.

> "The more the universe seems comprehensible, the more it also seems pointless" - Stephen Weinberg

### Molecule of life

James Watson and Francis Crick, the dynamic duo who cracked the genetic code, famously embraced atheism. Their relentless pursuit of scientific truth propelled them forward, unencumbered by spiritual considerations. 

> "[When asked by a student if he believes in any gods] Oh, no. Absolutely not... The biggest advantage to believing in God is you don't have to understand anything, no physics, no biology. I wanted to understand." ― James D. Watson

In an intriguing twist, Francis Collins, the director of the Human Genome Project, approached the enigma of DNA from an entirely different perspective. As a devout Christian, Collins found solace in the harmony between science and faith, marveling at the intricate complexity of life as a testament to a higher power. 

> "Science’s domain is to explore nature. God’s domain is in the spiritual world, a realm not possible to explore with the tools and language of science. It must be examined with the heart, the mind, and the soul—and the mind must find a way to embrace both realms" -  Francis S. Collins, The Language of God: A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief

### Conclusion

The beliefs held by famous scientists span the entire spectrum, demonstrating that science itself does not prove or deny the existence of God. The question of God's existence remains a non-falsifiable hypothesis. While we may not be certain about the existence of a supernatural entity, we can embrace the wonder and endless possibilities that the universe presents. Science and spirituality can coexist, as demonstrated by the myriad perspectives held by renowned scientists. Ultimately, we can find inspiration and enlightenment by exploring the diverse beliefs that shape the scientific community, allowing the universe to dazzle us with its infinite potential.
