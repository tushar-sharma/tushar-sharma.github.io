In search of a barber during my stay in Cartagena, I turned to Google Maps for assistance. It led me to Valentino Barberia, located at 130001, Cartagena de Indias, Bolívar. The ambiance of the place, complete with Spanish music playing softly in the background, immediately caught my attention. Upon entering, I requested a "corte de barba," seeking a neat beard trim to freshen up my look.<!-- truncate_here -->

The service I received was commendable. However, when it came time to pay, I learned that they only accepted cash, not credit cards. I asked if I could go to an ATM, and to my relief, the barber agreed. This display of trust, especially from someone I had just met in a new city, was both surprising and heartwarming.


Being more familiar with Mexican pesos, the Colombian currency proved a bit tricky for me. The banknotes were much larger, and I initially found it difficult to differentiate between the denominations. When I returned from the ATM, I almost paid more than what was due. Thankfully, the barber was honest and kind, taking only the necessary amount and advising me to be more careful with the local currency in the future.

I saw a portrait of pabla escabar on the wall which was quite amusing.
