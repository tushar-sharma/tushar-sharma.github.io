In search of a barber during my stay in Cartagena, I turned to Google Maps for assistance. It led me to Valentino Barberia, located at 130001, Cartagena de Indias, Bolívar. The ambiance of the place, complete with Spanish music playing softly in the background, immediately caught my attention. Upon entering, I requested a "corte de barba," seeking a neat beard trim to freshen up my look.<!-- truncate_here -->

In search of a barber during my stay in Cartagena, I turned to Google Maps for assistance. It led me to Valentino Barberia, located at 130001, Cartagena de Indias, Bolívar. The ambiance of the place, complete with Spanish music playing softly in the background, immediately caught my attention. Upon entering, I requested a "corte de barba," seeking a neat beard trim to freshen up my look.

I saw a portrait of pabla escabar on the wall which was quite amusing.

The service I received at Valentino Barberia was truly commendable, leaving no room for disappointment. However, when the time came to settle the bill, I discovered that the establishment only accepted cash payments, excluding credit cards. Concerned about the situation, I kindly requested if I could locate an ATM nearby, and to my profound relief, the barber graciously agreed. Witnessing this display of trust, particularly from someone I had just encountered in an unfamiliar city, was both unexpected and heartwarming.

Being more familiar with Mexican pesos, the Colombian currency proved a bit tricky for me. The banknotes were much larger, and I initially found it difficult to differentiate between the denominations. When I returned from the ATM, I almost paid more than what was due. Thankfully, the barber was honest and kind, taking only the necessary amount and advising me to be more careful with the local currency in the future.

Here's the final result of the beard trim:
