Dear Vishi, daily logs for May 29, 2025.

## Neuroplasticity

Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt in response to new information and challenges. I've been thinking about various ways I can increase neuroplasticity.

Recently, I started playing ping pong with my left (non-dominant) hand. It's fun and also keeps me competitive against people who arent great at the sport.

## Alan Wake 2

I'm currently stuck at the Mulligan and Thornton boss fight. Ammo is limited, and painkillers take time to consume. The boss fights in this game are difficult, even though I chose Story Mode (the easiest).

## Qwen AI bug 

I like Qwen AI, which is a model by Alibaba. However, there's a bug where it asks you to slide the button for verification.

The trick is to move the slider very slowly. Otherwise, you can still use the chat without logging in — but an annoying popup keeps appearing every 5 seconds, asking you to sign up.
