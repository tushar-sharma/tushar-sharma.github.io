Came across, [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXeyDCksPNY) , and found Aparna Gopalan. She is a news editor at Jewish Currents.

My hypothesis ? almost all major outlets outside US employes people from India who happen to be leftist. 

Jewish Currents is left wing.

Hypothesis ? birds of feather flock together

She has an interview with MEENA KANDASAMY[^link]

Hypothsis? she must be from humanity department. 


She studied Social Anthropology at Harvard University with focus is the reproduction of poverty through economic development projects in rural western India.
