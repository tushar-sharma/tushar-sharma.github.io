<p>Today the sleep was better. Yesterday I was sleep deprived. Hunger is the best ingredient to make any food delicious. Likewise a sound sleep is like a `manna from heaven` for me.</p>

I hope you are spendig time honing SQL skills. I hope you are making some progress in the online course at [Educative.io](https://www.educative.io/courses/introductory-guide-to-sql/). There's also another resource [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/) that has some fun exercise that you can explore. Next week we can take a SQL quiz together to see how well we fare against each other.{% include_relative tags.md %}

## Mixing Covid Vaccine

I have booked my United Airline flight from Delhi to Charlotte on June 13, 2021. Since I was departing in less than a month, I was in a dilemma if I should delay taking Covid vaccine since I wont be available in India for second dose. 

Due to unforseen event, India was struck by second Covid wave which is very devastating. US has banned the entry of most of visa types from India thanks to [Presendential Proclamation](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/04/30/a-proclamation-on-the-suspension-of-entry-as-nonimmigrants-of-certain-additional-persons-who-pose-a-risk-of-transmitting-coronavirus-disease-2019/). It's not yet known when the travel ban will be revoked. 

So I've decided to get vaccinated in India preferrably Covidshield (Oxfordâ€“AstraZeneca vaccine). If the US revoks the travel ban from India, I can take my second dose preferrably Pfizer vaccine i US. Though it's not yet conclusively clear if mixing vaccine is safe, however preliminary data shows it might produce more [antibodies](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-01359-3)

Earlier I wanted to get vaccinated with Pfizer or Moderna in USA since it has more than 90 percent efficacy. Covidshield has efficacy around [63%](https://www.who.int/news-room/feature-stories/detail/the-oxford-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-what-you-need-to-know). Sometimes it's wise to forego choices when there's a pandemic and [scarcity](https://www.fortuneindia.com/macro/scarcity-hit-india-looks-for-imported-vaccines/105492) of vaccine in India.

In the meantime, getting a first dose of vaccine in India is an uphill task. Most of my family is already vaccinated with Covidshield. I am still trying to find vaccination slots online for past two days but alas no luck. Most of the time either the [Cowin](https://www.cowin.gov.in/) website's server crashes or the slots are already booked. 


Hopefully  I'll get my first coronavirus vaccine doese soon. At least its better to have some immunity than nothing even if I miss my second dose due to some unforseen event.


### Warts

It has been several months since I noticed warts on my toes. It's not paintful, but it look like a black dot.

Earlier I thoguht it would disappear on its own, but it has persisted. So I had to consult a doctor. Due to Covid-19 restriction, it's better to schedule a doctor appointment online. You pay doctor fee using [Google Pay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Pay). After the payment,  the doctor video calls you through WhatsApp. 

Salicyclic acid is the most often recommended against plantar warts. Earlier I was using Salicylix SF6 which contains 6% Salicyclic acid. The results were not satisfactory. 

Currently, the doctor has recommended to use Watnil Salalin lotion which contains 16.7% Salicyclic acid. I will update if this treatment is effective. The doctor also advised to take Zinc tablets to [boost immunity](https://www.ouh.nhs.uk/patient-guide/leaflets/files/14029Pzinc.pdf) against warts.




## Code

### Poetry

I had a python project where I was trying to setup in a new laptop. I ran the following command

```bash
$ poetry install
```
Poetry crashed with the following error

```bash
Creating virtualenv usa in /home/project/.venv                             
  ModuleNotFoundError                                                                             
  No module named 'virtualenv.seed.via_app_data'
  at <frozen importlib._bootstrap>:973 in _find_and_load_unlocked            
```


My laptop has Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. 

```bash
$ poetry env info

Virtualenv
Python:         3.8.5
Implementation: CPython
Valid:          True

System
Platform: linux
OS:       posix
Python:   /usr

```

```bash
$ poetry --version
Poetry version 1.1.4
```

If you remove `python3-virtualenv` then `poetry` seems to work.

```bash
$ sudo apt remove --purge python3-virtualenv
```

## Stocks

One of the cool things I learned from my dad is how to use limit order while buying or selling stocks. Earlier I use to buy or sell stock at Market Order. This required extra efforts to track prices sometimes over days to find the optimum price. For instance I was tracking prices of [VTI](https://www.nyse.com/quote/ARCX:VTI) ETF. I wanted to buy the stock when it fell below $210. So I simply used a limit order to buy the stock when the price hit around $210. This limit order was opened for more than two weeks. So it saved me efforts to keep track of the stock price for two weeks.
