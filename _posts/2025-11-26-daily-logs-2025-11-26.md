## H1b

I see Whitehouse tweeting regularly on H1b these days. Today 
Karoline Leavitt  [tweeted](https://x.com/PressSec/status/1993687510396895496).

## Trump 

Trump tweeted this on [Twitter](https://x.com/RapidResponse47/status/1993767413024735321). It seems like relations between US and South Africa are detiorating. Elon Musk feels strongly about white people in South Africa since he's from South Africa himself.
