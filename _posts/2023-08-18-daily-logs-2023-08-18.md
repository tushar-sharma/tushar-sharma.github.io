### TreeMap in Java

TreeMap sorts all its entries according to their natural ordering. For an integer, this would mean ascending order and for strings, alphabetical order.

```java
Map<Integer, String> map = new TreeMap<>();
map.put(1, "a");
map.put(5, "e");
map.put(2, "b");
map.put(3, "c");
map.put(4, "d");

for(Map.Entry<Integer, String> entry : map.entrySet()){
  int key = entry.getKey();
  int value = entry.getValue();
  System.out.println("key is " + key + " and value is " + value);
}
```
