My experience on how to get Peru's tourist visa with India passport living in the US.

## Option 1

You don't need tourist visa if you have a US visa that's valid for at least six months before the day of arrival[^Peru]. However if you dont' fall under this category, then you need option 2.

## Option 2

### Rap Sheet request

Peru consulate expects a **negative criminal report**. You need to request for FBI's "Identity History Summary" (also called the "rap sheet"). It shows whether you have a criminal record in the U.S. If you have no record, it explicitly states "No arrest data found".

1. Go to [https://www.edo.cjis.gov/#/](https://www.edo.cjis.gov/#/)

    Enter your e-mail address to start the Identity History Summary Check Process!

2. Enter your email and remember the **pin**

    Would you like your social security number included on the response? 
    No

    How would you like to submit your fingerprint card? Electronic submission via third party


3. After completing the application, you will be asked to pay 18 dollars.

4. Next select USPS nearby for fingerprints

### Additional Documents

1. **Travel Itinerary:** You must provide complete flight details, including both international and domestic flights within Peru.  
   *Note:* When I first submitted only my international arrival and departure details, the Peru Embassy in Washington contacted me[^number] and requested the full itinerary. They asked me to email it to: `visas@conperdc.org`.

2. **Recent Bank Statements:** Include copies of your last three bank statements.

3. **Driver’s License Copy:** Attach a copy of your valid driver’s license.

4. **Original Passport:** Submit your original passport.

## Peru Visa

Finally got **Peru visa** stamped on my passport.
