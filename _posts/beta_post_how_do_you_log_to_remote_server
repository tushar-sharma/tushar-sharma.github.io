##  How to log to remote server in python 

A common way to log in python is to use the logging library 

```python
import logging
```

So to create a log file like log.txt you could do something like this 

```python
import logging
class MyLogger(object):
    def __init__(self, log_filename):
        logging.basicConfig(filename=log_filename,
                            filemode="w")
        self._logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
        self._logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
        
    def get_logger(self):
        return self._logger
   
  
logger = MyLogger() 
logger.debug("Logging started")
        
```

However sometimes you want to save logs directly to a remote server.
