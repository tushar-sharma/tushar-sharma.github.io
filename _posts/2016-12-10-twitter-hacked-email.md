## The Damn email

Many of the famous Indian twitter accounts were *hacked*. Some of famous people included Bharkha Dutt, Rahul Gandhi, Vijay Mallaya.

I saw that the intruders left behind their email address as legion_group@sigaint.org. But what can I know about the email address? This email was posted on Bharka Dutt's tweet when it was compromised, so there's no way to get the IP address of the email. 

The email belongs to the domain *sigaint.org*. A simple google search brings you to the idiosyncratic webpage.

The Website claims, "This IP address is used by a public email service that provides privacy to help journalists and activists combat the dragnet surveillance that exists on the Internet today". 

Ofcourse the intruders that compromised twitter accuounts were wise enough to leave secure email.
