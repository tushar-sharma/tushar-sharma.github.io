I am one of those select few who drinks tea from office vending machine. Most people love drinking coffee. I asked one of collegue why he doesn't like tea. he said it's because of `boston tea party`.

The Boston Tea Party was a political protest that occurred in 1773 in Boston, Massachusetts, during which American colonists, frustrated and angry at Britain for imposing "taxation without representation," dumped 342 chests of tea, imported by the British East India Company into the Atlantic Ocean. The event was a significant event leading up to the American Revolution, as it demonstrated the colonists' willingness to take direct action against British rule. The phrase "Boston Tea Party" has since become a widely recognized symbol of protest against unjust authority.

Does it ring a bell? We had a Salt March by Gandhi which was also a civil disobedience movement. It was a protest against British colonial rule and economic exploitation in India, in which Indian protesters walked to the sea to make salt in defiance of British laws that prohibited them from doing so.

There was another protest in India. It was called The Mahad Satyagraha, led by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar in 1927, was a protest against the practice of untouchability and the discrimination faced by Dalits in accessing public water sources. The protest involved a group of Dalit activists who marched to the Chavdar tank in Mahad, Maharashtra, and drank water from it to assert their right to access it. The protest was significant because it challenged the entrenched social hierarchy of caste and signaled the beginning of a larger movement for social justice and equality in India.
