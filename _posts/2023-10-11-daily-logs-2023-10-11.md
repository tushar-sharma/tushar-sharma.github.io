Dear Vishi, this is my daily log on Oct 11, 2023.

### Doom Emacs

First download emacs for [Mac](https://emacsformacosx.com/).

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs ~/.config/emacs
~/.config/emacs/bin/doom install
#  create an empty file
touch ~/.emacs.d/init.el
```

Next add `~/.config/emacs/bin` to `PATH`.

### Error: Port already in use

Often we see error that `port already in use`. This happens when another process is already running on the port. Simpler solution is to restart the machine but sometimes that's too cumbersome.

```bash
# Lets assume port 8082 is unavailable
# we try to list all processs on this port
lsof -i :8082
# This will gives us the PID for each process
# The (LISTEN) state indicates that this process is the one listening on the port
# kill the process
kill -9 PID
# -9 option sends a SIGKILL signal, which forces the process to terminate immediately
```

### Kopi Luwak

Learned today that **kopi luwak** is the most expensive coffee in the world. It's made from coffee beans that have been partially digested and excreted by the Indonesian palm civet

It's known for its unique taste, which is notable for its lack of bitterness and acidity. However it's also controversial.

Civets are typically snatched from their homes and life in the wild to be imprisoned alone in tiny, barren cages. There have been many complaints from international concerns, as well as journalistic programs regarding animal cruelty in these coffee farms.
