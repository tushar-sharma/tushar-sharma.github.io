Dear Vishi, this is my daily log on Oct 11, 2023.

### Doom Emacs

First download emacs for [Mac](https://emacsformacosx.com/).

```bash
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs ~/.config/emacs
~/.config/emacs/bin/doom install
#  to your PATH
```

Next add `~/.config/emacs/bin` to `PATH`.

### Error: Port already in use

Often we see error that `port already in use`. This happens when another process is already running on the port. Simpler solution is to restart the machine but sometimes that's too cumbersome.

```bash
# Lets assume port 8082 is unavailable
# we try to list all processs on this port
lsof -i :8082
# This will gives us the PID for each process
# The (LISTEN) state indicates that this process is the one listening on the port
# kill the process
kill -9 PID
# -9 option sends a SIGKILL signal, which forces the process to terminate immediately
```

### Kopi Luwak

Learned today that **kopi luwak** is the most expensive coffee in the world.
