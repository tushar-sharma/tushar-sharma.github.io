Dear Vishi, this is my daily log on Oct 11, 2023.<!-- truncate_here -->

Dear Vishi, this is my daily log on Oct 11, 2023.

### Doom Emacs

I wanted to try emacs again. I kind of ditched it since I started flirting with vim. First download emacs for [Mac](https://emacsformacosx.com/). Next open you terminal

```bash
$ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs ~/.config/emacs
~/.config/emacs/bin/doom install
#  we need to make sure the directory does not exist
$ rm -rf ~/.emacs.d/
$ cd ~/.config/emacs/bin
$ ./doom install
```

Also, add `~/.config/emacs/bin` to `$PATH`. 

### Error: Port already in use

Often we see error that `port already in use`. This happens when another process is already running on the port. Simpler solution is to restart the machine but sometimes that's too cumbersome.

```bash
# Lets assume port 8082 is unavailable
# we try to list all processs on this port
$ lsof -i :8082
# This will gives us the PID for each process
# The (LISTEN) state indicates that this process is the one listening on the port
# kill the process
$ kill -9 PID
# -9 option sends a SIGKILL signal, which forces the process to terminate immediately
```
