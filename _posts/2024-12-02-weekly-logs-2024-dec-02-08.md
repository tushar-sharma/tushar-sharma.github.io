### South Korea's martial law

South Korea's President Yoon declared a martial law which effectively banned all political activities. South Korea was the last country I expected to have a political turmoil. According to the martial law decree, all political activities are strictly prohibited and media and publications will be controlled. I know too little about this subject to write more about it.
