### Global Protect on Mac

Earlier I had a Windows work laptop which had Pulse secure VPN. I had migrated to a Macbook Pro and there's a GlobalProtect already installed. While connecting to the VPN my internet connection dropped. So I wanted to terminate GlobalProtect but it keep connecting again. I found this [website](https://joshcurry.co.uk/posts/how-to-quit-globalprotect-mac/) which had a command to unload the launchd script

```bash
$ launchctl unload /Library/LaunchAgents/com.paloaltonetworks.gp.pangp*
```

To use VPN again, 

```bash
$ launchctl load /Library/LaunchAgents/com.paloaltonetworks.gp.pangp*
```

### Warp Terminal

Today I found a new [Terminal](https://app.warp.dev/get_warp) for Mac. It's built in Rust and seems promising. Will update about it after using it for a while.
