## Pakistan's former President, Pervez Musharraf Dies

Just read news today that  Pervez Musharraf has died. There was a tweet by Mehbooba Mufti that I find problematic.

He was architect of Kargil war which was a fruitless war. Sending condolescences is formally accepted, but she wrote that he genuiely tried to address Kahsmir issues.

I guess there lot a disaggrements I have with BJP politics of Hindutava, but this tweet is in bad taste.
