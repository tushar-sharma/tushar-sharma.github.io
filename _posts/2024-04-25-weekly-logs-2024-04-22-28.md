Dear Vishi, this is my weekly logs from Apr 22 to Apr 28, 2024.

## Snapshot of my habits

## Southwest Airlines

Southwest airline has open seating. It means there are no seat number assigned to you in your boarding pass. You are called based on Groups. And the seats are first come first serve.

Drinks like water, coke, etc were complimentary. Small snacks was also given. Luckily open seating was not chaos. In India, I'm hundred percent sure that it would be a sabji-mandi if open seating comes.
