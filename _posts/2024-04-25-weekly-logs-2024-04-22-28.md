Dear Vishi, this is my weekly logs from Apr 22 to Apr 28, 2024.


## Southwest Airline

This was my first time using Wouthwest airline. It had open seating which means that there are no seat number assigned to you in the boarding pass. Only the division is by group number.

I boarded my flight from Raleigh to Cancun via Baltimore. Luckily it was not crowded and I enjoyed open seating which meant I got to pick my own seat. However I am not sure if this is a good option for a crowded flights.
