What's the purpose of life? I don't know. What the purposeo of a day? That' easy to answer. Each day has similar cycle: you wake up, go to loo, eat, drink and sleep. Next are the chores that you have to do like grocery, filing the tax, etc. What do you do the rest of your time? May be you can watch something, listen to music, develop some skills, pursue a hobby or connect with people. And the day ends but what remains are the memories of what you did and regrets of things you couldn't complete or attempted.

Today we went to USPS to get a money order. Earlier we were running around like headless chicken trying to find money order across stores like CVS, Walgreen, Haris Teether, etc. It seems like the money order machines were down for all yesterday.

I skipped gym today and I feel awful. Also I lost my airpods again. Going to gym without music feels dull and less motivated. That's a good excuse for which I can forgive myself. Luckily I found it using **Find My app**. Hopefully I go to gym tomorrow or else I would need another good excuse!

Richu is very particular about few things like she likes toilet seat to be closed and bathroom door to be closed. This reminds me of previous girlfriend, Paola. She told me that I had smell (not a good compliment for Indians). She was very  particular about taking bath before sleep. I despised it. Even thought the apartment was warm, but New York was very cold. And I didn't like to take bath in the night. I have dropped this habbit altogether. But I miss cucharita with Paola.

I wished Merry Christmas to Dianny. I forgot her birthday but luckily I covered it up saying that I remembered it and I hope she had a great birthday. SHe said : Espero que podamos coincidir pronto. I liked it even thought I am not sure if meet again. If I go to Cancun again, I will ask her to come to Playa del Carmen. But before that I need to send her my video of speaking Spanish.
