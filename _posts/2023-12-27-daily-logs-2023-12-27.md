What's the purpose of life? I don't know. What the purposeo of a day? That' easy to answer. Each day has similar cycle: you wake up, go to loo, eat, drink and sleep. Next are the chores that you have to do like grocery, filing the tax, etc. What do you do the rest of your time? May be you can watch something, listen to music, develop some skills, pursue a hobby or connect with people. And the day ends but what remains are the memories of what you did and regrets of things you couldn't complete or attempted.

Today we went to USPS to get a money order. Earlier we were running around like headless chicken trying to find money order across stores like CVS, Walgreen, Haris Teether, etc. It seems like the money order machines were down for all yesterday.

I skipped gym today and I feel awful. Also I lost my airpods again. Going to gym without music feels dull and less motivated. That's a good excuse for which I can forgive myself. Luckily I found it using **Find My app**. Hopefully I go to gym tomorrow or else I would need another good excuse!
