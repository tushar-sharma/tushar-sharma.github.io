**LSD** is a molecule. It was synthesized by Hoffman in 1936 while he was working at Sandoz Laboratories in Switzerland. 

Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound produced by certain species of mushrooms, commonly referred to as "magic mushrooms. It has a long history of use in indigenous rituals, particularly by the Mazatec people of Mexico, where it played a central role in spiritual and healing ceremonies. Psilocybin is converted in the body to psilocin, which is responsible for its psychoactive effects.


How is a molecule different than a compound? All compound are molecules but not all molecules are compound. A molecule is when two or more atoms bond together. Compound is a molecule when two or different atoms are bonded together. So O<sub>2</sub> is not a compound but a molecule.

**Acid trip** is psychedelic experience when consuming LSD. **Mushroop trip** is when you consume psilocybin. Both experiences often include altered perception of time, sensory enhancement, and profound changes in thought patterns. 

> "It's not the young who need to have an experience of the numinous, but those approaching the second half of life to negotiate its challenges." â€” Carl Jung

Clinical studies suggest that psilocybin can alleviate anxiety and depression in people with terminal cancer, helping them face death with reduced fear.

Similarly, MDMA (commonly known as ecstasy) has shown promise in treating PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) in clinical trials. MDMA tends to lead to a crash after effects wear off. LSD on other hand has afterglow (only if it's a good trip).

Marijuana has been researched for medical benefits, including pain relief and reduction of chemotherapy-induced nausea, but it does not share the same psychedelic properties as LSD or psilocybin.

LSD is a **Schedule 1 substance** that means the US goverment consider its' a drug of abuse with no accepted medical use and its illegal to sell and possess.

Timothy Leary, a psychologist and professor at Harvard, became a prominent advocate for the use of psychedelics after conducting experiments with psilocybin in the 1960s.

Leary's controversial methods and public advocacy led to his dismissal from Harvard and fueled a cultural backlash against psychedelics, contributing to their criminalization.

Who's a philosophical materialist? They believe matter is the fundamental substance of the universe and that everything, including consciousness, can be explained by physical laws without invoking divine or spiritual explanations.

LSD or psilocybin are not addictive. What about marijuana? Marijuana can lead to dependence in some individuals but is not considered as addictive as substances like cocaine or opioids. And cocaine is definately addictive. However people predisposition to mental illness should not consume it.

Acid trip can be good or bad. Hofmann who discovered LSD had a bad acid trip. He had to use bicycle to get home after consuming the drug since use of vehicles were restricted during wartime. LSD devoteees celebrate it as **bicycle day**. Do we know why someone would likely have a good or a bad acid trip?

LSD mimics serotonin and binds to serotonin receptor in brain. Serotonin maintians regular brain function, while LSD causes an exaggeration or altered activation of the same pathway. 

Another interesting difference between alcohol and LSD is that the former produces hangover where as the latter gives a afterglow. Afterglow is a state of well-being, clarity, and connectedness that lingers after the psychedellics effects have worn off. One of the reason for the afterglow is that LSD promotes growth of new neural connections. 

UDV is a religious sect that uses halluciongenic tea called ayahuasca. It contains DMT, a schedule 1 substance yet is allowed import into USA. Native Americans use peyote for their ceremonies. It originated in Brazil.

MDMA enhances empathy, trust and emotional openness. It is often referred to as an empathogen because it stimulates feelings of closeness and connection between people. Wny not just use it? MDMA stimulates the release of large amounts of serotonin, depleting the brain's reserves. Over time, frequent or high-dose use can cause oxidative stress, which may damage or destroy serotonin axons (the projections of neurons that release serotonin). Also long term use, can cause depression and anxiety. LSD primarily acts as a psychedelic, whereas MDMA functions as an empathogen/stimulant. So LSD doesn't deplete serotonin or pose a significant risk of neurotoxicity.

Jesse setup a nonprofit called Council on Spiritual Practices (CSP) which aims at promoting entheogens. csp.org offers great psychedelic research.

Good Friday Experiment by Walter Pahnke, psychiatrist under Timothy Leary. It's a double blind experiment with twenty religious students. One group received psilocybin and other placebo. Folks with psilocybin had classical mystical experience. Experiment proves that drug induced experience is no different than mystical experience. 

Holotropic breathwork, technique to induce psychedelics state of consciousness. 

Is MDMA toxic to brain so that's why it's aquired the reputation of club drug? 

Roland Griffiths went to burning man? What is it? Is it a festival? 

Why did certain mushroom evolved to produce molecule like LSD and psilocybin that mimics the serotonin and binds to serotonin receptor? What's the evolution advantage in producing such molecule? Or is it just luck?

How is fungus different than bacteria? Both are micro organism? Fungus have cells which have nucleus unlike bacteria. Nucleus is used for protecting DNA. Nuclues is used for cell division (that's how you get more cells). Fungi are multicellular and larger than bacteria. All bacteria are single celled and it's DNA is free-floating in the cell in area called nucleoid. That's why bacter are called prokaryotes which means before kernel (nucleus).  

What's mycelia? is it a membrane? And can it convey information? 

Some mushroom like `Galerina autumnalis` when eaten result in agonizing death. It's similar to Psilocybe stunzi. One way to identify is - if a grilled mushroom has purplish brown to black spores, and flesh bruises bluish, then it's likely a psiocyin producing species. Blue pigment is a sign of oxidized psilocin, one of the main pschoactive compounds in a psilocybe. Other is psilocybin which break downs psilocin in body.

Stoned Ape Theory - Ingestion of psilocybin caused rapid development of hominid brain for analytical thinking. Most scientist reject this hypothesis.

In 1620, Roman Catholic Church declared use of plants for divination was `act of superstition condemned as opposed to the purity and integrity of our Holy Catholic Faith`.

What's the difference between psilocybin and psilocin compound? Are both compound found in magic mashroom? Psiolocybin breaks down into Psilocin. Psilocin is what causes psychedelic effects. It's structure is similar to serotonin, a neuro transmitter.

What do you think of **stoned ape theory**? Does the consumption of mushrooms by early humans led to drastic increase in our brain. I thought it was cooking. Cooking food was a revolution as we were able to absorb more nutrients.

> As soon as we unloaded and stowed our gear, we laced up our boots and headed out to look for mushrooms

Azzie mushroom which is part of psychedelic mushroom has side effect like temporary paralysis. Cultivation of this species is illegal in United States.

Why are cows not affected by mushroom containing psilocybin? Does it have to do with their digestive system?
