**LSD** is a molecule. It was synthesized by Hoffman in 1936 while he was working at Sandoz Laboratories in Switzerland. 

Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound produced by certain species of mushrooms, commonly referred to as "magic mushrooms. It has a long history of use in indigenous rituals, particularly by the Mazatec people of Mexico, where it played a central role in spiritual and healing ceremonies.
Psilocybin is converted in the body to psilocin, which is responsible for its psychoactive effects. 

**Acid trip** is psychedelic experience when consuming LSD. **Mushroop trip** is when you consume psilocybin. Both experiences often include altered perception of time, sensory enhancement, and profound changes in thought patterns. 

> "It's not the young who need to have an experience of the numinous, but those approaching the second half of life to negotiate its challenges." â€” Carl Jung

Clinical studies suggest that psilocybin can alleviate anxiety and depression in people with terminal cancer, helping them face death with reduced fear.

Similarly, MDMA (commonly known as ecstasy) has shown promise in treating PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) in clinical trials.

Marijuana has been researched for medical benefits, including pain relief and reduction of chemotherapy-induced nausea, but it does not share the same psychedelic properties as LSD or psilocybin.

LSD is a schedule 1 substance that means the US goverment consider its' a drug of abuse with no accepted medical use and its illegal to sell and possess.

Timothy Leary, a psychologist and professor at Harvard, became a prominent advocate for the use of psychedelics after conducting experiments with psilocybin in the 1960s.

Leary's controversial methods and public advocacy led to his dismissal from Harvard and fueled a cultural backlash against psychedelics, contributing to their criminalization.

Who's a philosophical materialist? They believe matter is the fundamental substance of the universe and that everything, including consciousness, can be explained by physical laws without invoking divine or spiritual explanations.

LSD or psilocybin are not addictive. What about marijuana? Marijuana can lead to dependence in some individuals but is not considered as addictive as substances like cocaine or opioids. And cocaine is definately addictive. However people predisposition to mental illness should not consume it.
