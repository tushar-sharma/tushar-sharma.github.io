Dear Vishi, daily logs for June 9, 2025

## Coffee and Coackroaches

I learned that cockroach residues can be present in coffee. The FDA allows up to 5% insect residue in certain food products, including coffee. Cockroaches are often attracted to coffee beans stored in warehouses. It is not financially viable to completely separate roaches from coffee during processing.

Three reasons I stay away from coffee:

* It may contain cockroach residue

* I don’t like the taste

* It fails the Ames test

> Note: The Ames test is a widely used assay to detect substances that can cause genetic mutations. If coffee "fails" this test in its raw form, it typically refers to unbrewed or concentrated extracts — brewed coffee usually does not show mutagenic activity due to dilution and chemical transformation during roasting. 


## Python

In a simple Python program:


{% template  customCode.html %}
---
id: e2150965874553947a1467ce0efed189
file: ex1.py
---
{% endtemplate %}


The `__new__` method is a low-level constructor that’s usually hidden from view. The `__init__` method is called after `__new__` and is used to initialize instance attributes.


`self` is just like `this` which is used to refrence the current instance of the class. 


### List Cmprehension 

It's like a for loop in a one line 

{% template  customCode.html %}
---
id: e2150965874553947a1467ce0efed189
file: ex2.py
---
{% endtemplate %}

Here `a+1` is  computed for each element. 

### Lambda

Lambda functions originate from lambda calculus. They provide a shorthand way to define small, anonymous functions:


{% template  customCode.html %}
---
id: e2150965874553947a1467ce0efed189
file: ex3.py
---
{% endtemplate %}
