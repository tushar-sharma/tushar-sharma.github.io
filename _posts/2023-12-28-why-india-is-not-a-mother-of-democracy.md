### Why India is not a Mother of Democracy

In 2023, as India assumed the presidency of G20 summit, the Ministry of Cultured an exhibitions titled "Bharat: The Mother of Democracy". North Korea officially refers itself as "Democratic People's Republic of Korea" and I dont want to expound on how ridiciculous it sounds to others. So we can dismiss official titles used by countries. I am not a prisoner of past so I wont argue if democries indeed had roots in ancient Rome or Greece civilization or had some credence in ancient self-governing bodies and assemblies in India. However a good question would be how good democrcy India is?

I can call a grass green even in Afghansitan ruled by Taliban or in North Korea under Kim Jong Un without any fear of repercussion. These are not free societies. True test of a free society is having a freedom to say that a grass is not green and not fear losing your head or imprisonment. Or calling the supreme leader fat or douchebag or make blasphemous statements like there is no God but a Spaghetti monster.
