I regularly play badminton at the Marion Diehl Recreation Center and Pool, where intermediate sessions are held every Wednesday from 7:00 pm to 9:00 pm. To secure a spot, you can make a reservation by calling +1 980-314-1300. From my experience, if you're looking to reserve a spot for the entire month, it's best to call on the 15th of the preceding month.<!-- truncate_here -->

Be sure to bring your own racket. While there are usually birdies available, you might want to bring your own just in case.
