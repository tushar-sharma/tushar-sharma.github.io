I usually play at Marion Diehl Recreation Center and Pool. The timings are 7pm to 9pm on Wednesday for intermediate. You can make reservation by calling this number +1 980-314-1300. For my experience, I usually call on 15th of a month if I need to make reservation for entire month. 

Bring your racket, there are people with their birdie. You can also bring your own birdie.
