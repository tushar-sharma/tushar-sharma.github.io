## Stripe

1. Stripe company says, "Over 1,300 Stripe pull requests merged each week are completely minion-produced, human-reviewed, but contain no human-written code (up from 1,000 last week)." [^stripe]

This shows that companies like Stripe can have most feature changes handled by LLMs. Previously, language models were mostly used as search assistants, but now they’re fundamentally changing how software development is done. It makes you wonder if software developers might end up like “cave people” in a few years.
