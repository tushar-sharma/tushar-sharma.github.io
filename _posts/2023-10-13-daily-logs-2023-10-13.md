I ran a treadmill for over 2 miles. I took a break after every 0.5 mile. Since my right airpod is missing, I am learning to run without music. Not sure pros or cons of listening music while running. Nevertheless I dont have a choice.

Today was leg's day. Started with leg curl on machine. Next barbell squat and inclined leg press.
