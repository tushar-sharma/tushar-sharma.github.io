Dear Vishi, this is my daily log for Oct 13, 2023.


## La Fitness

I ran a treadmill for over 2 miles. I took a break after every 0.5 mile. Since my right airpod is missing, I am learning to run without music. Not sure pros or cons of listening music while running. Nevertheless I dont have a choice.

Today was leg's day. Started with leg curl on machine. Next barbell squat and inclined leg press.

## Donnie Darko

I watched Donnie Darko today at Ayrsley Grand Cinema [^addr]. The film's conclusion, with its foray into time travel, genuinely piqued my interest. While its portrayal of wormholes and the underlying science felt somewhat superficial, it's evident that the movie leans more towards drama. From the outset, it paints a picture of a young man who seems to grapple with schizophrenia. The graphics may not have been groundbreaking, but the story's depth made up for it.
