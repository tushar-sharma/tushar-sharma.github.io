## La Fitness

I ran a treadmill for over 2 miles. I took a break after every 0.5 mile. Since my right airpod is missing, I am learning to run without music. Not sure pros or cons of listening music while running. Nevertheless I dont have a choice.

Today was leg's day. Started with leg curl on machine. Next barbell squat and inclined leg press.

## Donnie Darko

I watched Donnie Darko today at Ayrsley Grand Cinema [^addr]. I kind liked the ending of the movie. The science part in the movie was not profound. However it was a good watch though some scenes were boring.
