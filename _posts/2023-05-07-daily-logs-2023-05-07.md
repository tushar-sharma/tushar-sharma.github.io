Dear Vishi, this is my daily log for May 7, 2023.

### Sleep

I am still having jetlag I guess. I sleep at 3 am and wake at 8 am. It's been almost a week. There is hilarious quote about sleep

> "Dear sleep, I’m sorry we broke up this morning. I want you back!" — Anonymous

I like to collect quotes and keep a personal [collection](https://randomwits.com/quotes/).


### Passport from US Embassy

I had applied for dropbox stamping on May 1, 2023. I am still waiting for my passport. More than a week has passed. I made a foolhardy plan to only give 2 week buffer before boarding my flight. Hope the passport comes on time.

### 30 Days of LC Javascript challenge

There is a 30 day challenge hosted at [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/discuss/study-guide/3458761/day-4-30-days-of-lc-javascript-challenge).

####  Apply Transform Over Each Element in Array

```
Given an integer array arr and a mapping function fn, return a new array with a transformation applied to each element.

Input: arr = [1,2,3], fn = function plusone(n) { return n + 1; }
Output: [2,3,4]
```

The solution is straightforward to use `map`

```javascript
var map = function(arr, fn) {
   return arr.map(fn);
};
```

#### Create Hello World Function

```
Write a function createHelloWorld. It should return a new function that always returns "Hello World".

Input: args = []
Output: "Hello World"
```

Solution:

```javascript
var createHelloWorld = function() {
  return function(..args) {
    return "Hello World"
  }
}
```

#### Counter

```
Given an integer n, return a counter function. This counter function initially returns n and then returns 1 more than the previous value every subsequent time it is called (n, n + 1, n + 2, etc).


const counter = createCounter(10)
counter() // 10
counter() // 11
counter() // 12
```

Solution:

```javascript
var createCounter = function(n) {
    return function() {
        return n++;
    };
};

```

This is a simple example of using closures in javascript.

1. Closure are nested function which has access to the outer scope

2. After the outer function is returned, by keeping a reference to the inner function (the closures) we prevent the outer scope to be destroyed.

### SonarQube exclude directories

Sometimes you want to skip certain folders for scanning. Add following option to the config

```
-Dsonar.exclusions=**/site-packages/**
```

### Top Gun movie

I watched it today. It was in my bucket list. I liked the soundtrack and visual effects.  I guess story could have been more captivating.

### ng-book

I am currenlty reading `ng-book`

Create a new project

```bash
$ ng new angular-hello-world
```

In the file `angular-hello-world/src/index.html`

```html
<body>
<app-root> </app-root>
</body>
```

the `app-root` is where application is rendered. It's a component.

To run the application, go to `localhost:4200`

```bash
$ ng serve --port 4200
```

#### Create a component

```bash
$ ng generate component hello-world
```

Component consist of two parts

1. a component decorator

2. a component definition class

Open the file `angular-hello-world/src/app/hello-world/hello-world.component.ts`

```javascript
import {Component, OnInit} from '@angualar/core';

@Component({
    selector: 'app-hello-world',
    templateUrl: './hello-world.component.html',
    styleUrl: ['./hello-world.component.css']
})

export class HelloWorldComponent implements OnInit{
  constructor() {}

  ngOnInit(){}
}
```

`@Component` is the decorators. In the `angular-hello-world/src/app/app.component.html`, we can use

```html
<app-hello-world></app-hello-world>
```
