### Movies

I watched the movie "Founders" about McDonald. Without spoilers, it's a fascinating account about the beginning of Mcdonald. 

I also wateched "The Big Short". It's a movie about Housing crisis in America.

###  Coding Pratice

I solved the leetcode problem [Largest Element in an Array After Merge Operations](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-element-in-an-array-after-merge-operations/).



### Angular

So I have a `REST` Endpoint that gives the following JSON

```
{
    "branch": "testing",
    "stages": [
        {
            "status": "passed
        },
        {
            "status": "failed"
        }
    ]
}
```

I am using ChartJS to render this in a graph..
