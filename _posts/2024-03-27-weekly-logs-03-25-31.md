## Magnesium

I usually take two vitamins supplements : 

* B12 on empty stomach

* D3 with food

Saw some tweets like [JonLOCKD](https://twitter.com/JonLOCKD/status/1771474009646895565) and [foundmyfitness](https://twitter.com/foundmyfitness/status/1773061585390686670). They were mostly selling magnesium as wonder pill to include in your diet.

Question? Can't we get magnesium from food? I checked foods like spinach, banana, avacado, braccoli, etc which are good sources of magnesium.

Or do we need to take supplements? Big pharmas have huge incentive to promote supplements. Do supplements really help if a person doesn't have any acute deficiency and eats generaly healthy diet full of fruits and leafy vegetable? 

But what about scientific studies? Problem with scientific studies

1. Peer reviewed 

2. Who's funding the research 

3. Sample Size

4. Any counter studies 


## First Man Movie

Saw "First Man" movie. I liked the visuals of the movie and it looked realistic. I wished the movie talked more about rocket science than life of Neil Armstrong. 

I learned about the Gemini Project. It was essential for Apollo mission. Google also launched Gemini AI (rebranding of Bard). So this mission must be super important?

## Filing Taxes 

Instead of using TurboTax, I am trying freetaxusa.com for the first time. It's cheaper than turbotax and I have many of the entries myself but I guess I dont want to shelve out expensive Turbotax like last time.
