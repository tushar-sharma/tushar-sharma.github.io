## Magnesium

I usually take two vitamins supplements : 

* B12 on empty stomach

* D3 with food

Saw some tweets like [JonLOCKD](https://twitter.com/JonLOCKD/status/1771474009646895565) and [foundmyfitness](https://twitter.com/foundmyfitness/status/1773061585390686670). They were mostly selling magnesium as wonder pill to include in your diet.

Question? Can't we get magnesium from food? I checked foods like spinach, banana, avacado, braccoli, etc which are good sources of magnesium.

Or do we need to take supplements? Big pharmas have huge incentive to promote supplements. Do supplements really help if a person doesn't have any acute deficiency and eats generaly healthy diet full of fruits and leafy vegetable? 

But what about scientific studies? Problem with scientific studies

1. Peer reviewed. That's a starting point.

2. Who's funding the research? Like clinical studies funded by wine companies on benefits of red wine should raise eyebrows.

3. Sample Size

4. Replicability and Counter Studies

## Filing Taxes 

Instead of using TurboTax, I am trying freetaxusa.com for the first time. It's cheaper than turbotax and I have many of the entries myself but I guess I dont want to shelve out expensive Turbotax like last time.
