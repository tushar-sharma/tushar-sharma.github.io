## Magnesium

I usually take two vitamin supplements, B12 on an emtpy stomach and D3 along side food. However, I've come accross lots of recommendations for magnesium supplements like this [tweet](https://twitter.com/JonLOCKD/status/1771474009646895565) and There's another [tweet](https://twitter.com/foundmyfitness/status/1773061585390686670).


So I wanted to research more on this. First what's magnesium L-Threonate? It's a salt formed from mixing magnesium and threonic acid, a water-soluble substance derived from the metabolic breakdown of vitamin C. 


I am to investiage more if taking magnesium extra than normal healthy diet helps or not. Much of these claims are pushed by huge pharmaceutical companies having vested interest in selling supplements. Like many of the clinical studies on red wine or dark chocolate are funded by companies who themselves manufactures thems. So there's a conflict of interest.

## First Man Movie

Saw "First Man" movie. I liked the visuals of the movie and it looked realistic. I wished the movie talked more about rocket science than life of Neil Armstrong. 

I learned about the Gemini Project. It was essential for Apollo mission. Google also launched Gemini AI (rebranding of Bard). So this mission must be super important?
