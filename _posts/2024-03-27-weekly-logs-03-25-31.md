## Magnesium

I know two types of vitamins that I usualy take : 

* B12 : empty stomach

* D3 : with food

Then I came accross this [tweet](https://twitter.com/JonLOCKD/status/1771474009646895565). 

> Take magnesium bisglycinate 30
Mins before bed and magnesium L-Threonate when you wake up in the morning. Youâ€™ll feel superhuman and sleep like a baby

So I wanted to research more on this.
