## Magnesium

I know two types of vitamins that I usualy take : 

* B12 : empty stomach

* D3 : with food

Then I came accross this [tweet](https://twitter.com/JonLOCKD/status/1771474009646895565). 

> Take magnesium bisglycinate 30 Mins before bed and magnesium L-Threonate when you wake up in the morning. You’ll feel superhuman and sleep like a baby

So I wanted to research more on this. First what's magnesium L-Threonate? It's a salt formed from mixing magnesium and threonic acid, a water-soluble substance derived from the metabolic breakdown of vitamin C. 

There's another [tweet](https://twitter.com/foundmyfitness/status/1773061585390686670), Men with the highest magnesium levels experienced a 40% decrease in all-cause mortality and a 50% reduction in cancer deaths.

I am to investiage more if taking magnesium extra than normal healthy diet helps or not. Much of these claims are pushed by huge pharmaceutical companies having vested interest in selling supplements. Like many of the clinical studies on red wine or dark chocolate are funded by companies who themselves manufactures thems. So there's a conflict of interest.

## First Man Movie

Saw "First Man" movie. I liked the visuals of the movie and it looked realistic. I wished the movie talked more about rocket science than life of Neil Armstrong. 

I learned about the Gemini Project. It was essential for Apollo mission. Google also launched Gemini AI (rebranding of Bard). So this mission must be super important?
