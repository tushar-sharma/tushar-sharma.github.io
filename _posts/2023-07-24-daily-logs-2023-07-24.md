Dear Vishi, this is my daily log for July 24, 2023.

### Twitter has been renamed X

I logged into twitter today and saw the logo has changed. The bird logo has been replaced with letter 'X'. 

Also X.com would redirect to twitter.com, Elon Musk said. However, there seems to be some DNS issue as I am redirected to GoDaddy website.
