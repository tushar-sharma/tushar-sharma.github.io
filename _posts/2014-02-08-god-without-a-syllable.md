I was lying on a meadow watching the clouds scudding across the sky. Suddenly the Machiavelli alarm pulled me out of dreams. The sun had crawled up to the sky. I glanced out of the window across the roof. My wandering eyes caught sight of a nomadic cat. She was licking up her claws. Half way beyond her was another window where hung a cloth. The cloth was fluttering in the swift wind. For a moment I captured this with my drowsy eyes. Soon a lady came and took the cloth away. I saw the cloth disappear before my eyes. I also lost the sight of the cat which also vanished. Before me stood an empty roof. 

It dawn to me that the roof appeared like a portrait with different strokes of colors. A moment ago, the roof had the tinge of cat and a cloth and a moment later all the stoker have vanished. I wondered if I am the same person which I was a moment before. The life itself looked like a mammoth portrait with each one of us resembling different colors only to eventually swept away by the current of Time.<!-- truncate_here -->

#### Paradox of Choice

After regaining consciousness and relinquishing my bed, I decided to stroll out in the morn. I quickly slipped into my pyjamas and shoes. The sky had the company of a dwindling moon who looked upset at the ascending sun. Occasionally birds chirped and bade the moon goodbye. The winds descended and raced with me to keep me company. 

Pavements on Indian roads are designed with nefarious motive. A person walking on them needs to master the art of maneuvering. Sometimes you may encounter among other things cows, stray dogs, two-wheelers and sometimes wandering people. After meandering through myriad streets, I came across a divergence on a street. I stood still and soon sweat started pouring down my face along with some thoughts. I was stuck with a choice however trivial. And I wondered what are my odds that I make a right choice?

Universe can be modeled into deterministic and non-deterministic. Einstein always envisaged universe through determinism. It obeys laws of physics, is symmetrical and elegant. It was based on physical outcome of causality which states that for every action produces an action. All our non-microscopic activities follow deterministic model. 

Another way of looking at the universe is through the lens of non-determinism. Randomness is queen here. No one can predict what the next outcome would come. Everything that happens happens at the whim of dice. The microscopic particles in the quantum world follows the non-deterministic model. 

The paradox here is whether our choices deterministic or not? Do I have a free will? If yes then the position of stars or whim of god doesn't interfere with my life. If not then all my choices are mere illusion of some grand higher design. Einstein was accepted non-determinism. In fact he spent last years of his life trying to find alternate to non-deterministic model.

#### The tale of religion


The day had grown and so had the traffic. In midst of honking and avoiding people along the pavement, I came across a temple, a common sight in India. A priest was ringing the bells with great fervour.  As a child I remembered visiting temples chanting sacred Sanskrit hymns that I believed could usher miracles. Few distance away I spotted a church, which had a shrill morning choir resonating across the street. 

A famous myth in India is of Ramayana, one of the great Hindu epic.  With the instruction of Nala, Rama's army (Vanara) inscribes  name of Rama (राम)  in  the stones. The stones starts to float and Rama's army reaches Lanka to rescue Sita. 

Another famous tale is of miracle of  Jesus Christ. As per as Gospel, Jesus could turn water into wine. He also exemplify other miracles like curing blind, poor and lepers.

I have a high reverence for both Rama and Jesus Christ. Whether they had supernatural powers is immaterial too me compared to the message they left behind. Rama inspires quality of ideal person (purushottama) and Jesus left a message of compassion for humanity. 

Most of the religion rely on miracles for indoctrinating people. Indoctrination robs people of questioning authority. Countless innocent people are prosecuted in the name of religion. 

But what is miracle? Is talking to someone over long distance over phone miracle? It's not since in this century most of us are taught how technology works. But if I could time travel to medieval past and reveal to them an ordinary phone, they might held me in high reverence. One century's magic is another's century's science. 


#### Chicken or the Egg

Chicken or the egg is the causality dilemma. Both can't come independent of each other. Similarly it's difficult to fathom beginning of universe since at the end something must come out of nothing. 

Since evolution and appearance of modern man, man has wondered from cave to savanna sometimes in hunt for food, sometimes for hunt for truth. The sudden thunderstorm could easily usher fear of unknown super powers. Ignorance of diseases could incline one to superstition.

In earlier times mythology alone was sufficient to provide answers to fundamental question like where we came from.

The genesis is a beautiful story. These are the type of story you would tell your children. God forms Adams from the 'dust of the ground' and and then 'breathed into his nostrils the breath of life', causing him to 'become a living soul'. He then place him in the Garden of Eden and giving him commandment of every tree of garden except the 'tree of knowledge of good and evil'.

Hinduism also contain creation myths. One such myth pertains to proto-Indo European origin in Rig Veda, where a cosmic being (Purusha) is dismembered by gods. Though the Nasadiya Sukta (Hymn of Creation) of Rig Veda takes a rather agnostic approach. 

<blockquote>
Whence was it produced? Whence is this creation?<br>
The gods came afterwards, with the creation of this universe.
- Nasadiya Sukta
</blockquote>

But curiosity has led men to unravel new paradigms. A famous example of this is the 'Allegory of Cave' by Pluto. In this Pluto describes gathering of people who have lived all their lives inside cave facing a blank wall. When they see projections of shadows on the wall of things in front of the fire, they give name to them. Then one cave men escaped the cave to understand the shadows. 

Most scientist believe that the answer to the chicken and egg paradox lies in quantum fluctuation which states that conservation of energy could be violated if the time is small. Hence something can come out of nothing. 

#### The Big Bang

Imagine if you were a fish born and raise in aquarium. You would have no idea of the world outside the aquarium. Your awareness would have been restricted within the periperal of the aquarium. If I were to ask you then, “where did the aquarium came from”. You would have been bewildered.

Our situation is quite akin to that of fish. We live in a bigger aquarium of three spacial and a time dimension universe. Our universe is similar to a trampoline where we roll along its surface creating warps. These warps curve the space time continuum. The space-time continuum could be bend, stretch and shrink but cannot be teared apart. Hence there's no way to escape. Some people postulate on wormholes as means to escape this universe but there's a long way before we actually discover and travel through any of them.

Doppler had conjured way to calculate frequency of two distant objects. Using this concept, Hubble extended and applied to our own galaxy. He saw the the galaxies are in fact moving apart. If we reverse the steps, we came at a point of infinite gravity, called singularity. 

People had believed in axioms of Euclidean goemetry of space which means that sum of angle of triangle is always 180. Hence they difficulty accepting Hubble's idea of expanding universe. They thought the universe had always existed and believed in Steady State Theory. 

But the discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation in 1965 confirmed the authenticity of Big Bang theory. These are result of light from ancient stars which has been scattered by galactic dust.

#### Anthropic Principle

If I ask why does it rain, most of us would feel insulted on being ask such a trivial question. A kid in the five standard could very well compose in the following words, “It rains because the water from different parts of earth evaporate into water vapours. The vapours rise up as they are lighter than air which in turn condense into water which fall as rain”.

But if flip the question and instead ask does it rain so that all the living being on earth could live, most of us would find it difficult to reach conclusion. This is called anthropic principle. Does the physical laws of the universe is compatible with conscious life that observes it? Why does the distance between earth and sun is optimum to sustain life? Why the optimum size of moon helps earth not to wobble? Had the precise values of fundamental physical constants not what they are, the whole universe would simple collapse in itself.


#### Ultimate truth

I once encountered two pretty girls who I presumed were Christian missionary. They asked me if they believed in Jesus. I replied in affirmative and said, 'I believe in Jesus, Krishna or any other Higher Being there is'. 'But there can be only path to ultimate truth', they revolted. This made me recall a reply by Swami Vivekanada on which religion is true.

<blockquote>
As so many rivers, having their source in different mountains, roll down, crooked or straight, and at last come into the ocean --- so, all these various creeds and religions, taking their start from different standpoints and running through crooked or straight courses, at last come unto Thee.
