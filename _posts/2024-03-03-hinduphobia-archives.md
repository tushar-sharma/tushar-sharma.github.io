## one of the most obscene disgusted sacred books

Recently I saw a video of Slavoj Žižek, Slovenian philosopher, ranting against Bhagavad Gita which is one of the holiest book for the Hindus.

In the video, he refers to Bhagavad Gita as the "one of the most obscene disgusted sacred books (sic)". Had he directed similar criticism for other Abrahamic religions, the repercussions might have been more severe. He still has his job as International director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humantities. But bashing Hinduism has no severe backlash:

* There is no Hindu majority countries except India and Nepal. 

* Much of the left in India vehemently opposes Hindusim in guise of "dismantling Brahmanism".

## misognisitc pig

Audrey truschke, a historian of South Asia and an associate professor at Rutgers University, referred to Rama, a revered diety in Hindusim, as a [misognisitc pig](https://www.newslaundry.com/2018/04/30/the-unscholarly-dishonesty-of-audrey-truschke). Recenlty she wrote an article for the [Time magazine](https://time.com/6564148/ayodhya-ram-temple-modi-india/) on the occassion of inaguration of Rama temple in India and she continues to teach at Rutgers University. 

On contrary, consider this. In U.S, Erika López Prater, an adjunct professor at Hamline University, lost her job becasue she showed painting of Islamic art that was deemed offensive by some Muslims.

## Why Do We Say No to Holi?

Equality labs opposes [celebration of Holi](https://browngirlmagazine.com/why-do-we-say-no-to-holi-a-guide-to-challenge-casteism/). Holi is a significant Hindu festival celebrated as the Festival of Colours.

##  Brahmins, who are historically indolent

[The Wire](https://thewire.in/caste/does-india-need-a-caste-based-quota-in-cricket) published an article on why cricket sport in India needs caste based reservation. Caricature Brahmins as, "Brahmins, who are historically indolent, like cricket because it involves hours of merely standing around and an absence of physical contact."
