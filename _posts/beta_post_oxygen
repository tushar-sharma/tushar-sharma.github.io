## More Oxygen the better? 

I always assumed that oxygen was benevolent magical gas. It had a kind of halo around it everytime I wrote the its equation in my science class. It was in my science class that I learned that oxygen was only 21 % in our atmosphere. Woudn't be awesome if atmosphere had 100% of oxygen?

## Origin of oxygen

Oxygen has an atomic number of 8. It means it has eight protons, eight neutrons & eight electrons.  It was discovered by Joseph Priestley by focussing sunlight on to mercuric oxide (HgO), and collecting the gas which came off. It made the candle burn brighter. 

But how was it created? It seems that the answer lies in a global catastrophe. 

Earlier life on earth was predominatly anaerobic.  However 2.3 billions years ago, cynobacteria invented oxygenic photosynthesis. They used sunlight to split water into oxygen and hydrogen ions. The oxygen released was so toxic that led to the first mass extinction on earth.


## But why do humans need oxygen?


Human body is made of trillion of cells. Now each cells needs energy to live. They get this energy by a storing a molecule called adenosine triphospate (ATP). So they need to burn the food to generate ATP. It's often called nature's batteries or formally "molecular unit of currency" of intracellular energy transfer.

But how did ATP evolved? How did inanimate matter turn into living cells? It's called abiogenesis which is still unsolved problem in science. 

However once we have a living cell, we can understand how oxygen is required for cellular respirations. As we consume food, lipids are broken down into fatty acids, protein into amino acids, and carbohydrates into glucose. Then fatty acids, proteins and carbohydrates are oxidized to convert to ATP molecule. 

But how does each cell cell receive oxygen? Hemoglobin is a protein in our red blood cells that carries oxygen to the cells & tranfser carbon oxide out of the body. Hemoglobin has iron which binds to oxygen. 

## Do all living beings need oxygen for survival? 

Not really. Infact billions of years ago, most of the life on earth was anaeobic. It's the irony that oxygen was responsible for the first mass extinction on earth. The cynobacteria produced a toxic gas called oxygen which wiped out most of the lives on earth some billions of years ago.

## But wait, Dont plants create oxygen?

Plants have a pigment called chlorophyll which directly absorb sunlight. It uses this ADT to convert it to starch. 

## Why do some living beings use oxygen & some not? 

## But at leeast for humans oxygen is better?

Not really. 

NOt so. Oxygen is required for buring the food. However it also leads to creation of free radicals. Excess of free radicals leads to numerous problems.
