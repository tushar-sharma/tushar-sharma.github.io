## More Oxygen the better? 

I always assuemd that oxygen was magical gas which was boon for our survival. I learned in the science class that oxygen is only 21% of our atmosphere. It would be a great idea, I often wondered, if we could have more percentage of oxygen in our atmosphere. The more the merrier.

## But why do we need oxygen?

Human body is made of trillion of cells. Now each cells needs energy to live. So they burn the food by a process called metabolism which require oxygen. 

But how does each cell cell receive oxygen? Hemoglobin is a protein in our red blood cells that carries oxygen to the cells & tranfser carbon oxide out of the body. Hemoglobin has iron which binds to oxygen. 

## Do all living beings need oxygen for survival? 

Not really. Infact billions of years ago, most of the life on earth was anaeobic. It's the irony that oxygen was responsible for the first mass extinction on earth. The cynobacteria produced a toxic gas called oxygen which wiped out most of the lives on earth some billions of years ago.

## But wait, Dont plants create oxygen?

Plants have a pigment called chlorophyll which directly absorb sunlight. It uses this ADT to convert it to starch. 

## Why do some living beings use oxygen & some not? 

## But at leeast for humans oxygen is better?

Not really. 

NOt so. Oxygen is required for buring the food. However it also leads to creation of free radicals. Excess of free radicals leads to numerous problems.
