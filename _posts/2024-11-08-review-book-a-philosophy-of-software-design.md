In the Waterfall model, development is a linear process with distinct phases: requirements, design, implementation, testing, and deployment. Each phase must be completed before the next begins. This rigid approach can lead to challenges in adapting to changing requirements or unexpected issues.

Agile methodologies, like Scrum or Kanban, emphasize iterative development. A project is broken down into smaller, manageable iterations or sprints. Each sprint involves planning, designing, implementing, and testing a specific set of features. This iterative approach allows for flexibility and continuous improvement.
