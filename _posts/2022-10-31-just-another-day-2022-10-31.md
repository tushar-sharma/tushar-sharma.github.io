### Renewing Driving License

My driving license has expired. The driving license in United States depends upon your visa status. If you are on H1B work visa, you need new I-797 form to be able to renew status. 

I took Uber in the morning to go to the DMV[^add]office. To my dismay, there were only allowing appointment only folks. Next available appointment I saw on the website was after few months. Walkins were permitted only after 2pm. So I stood in the queue for more than 4 hours trying to get in. I killed my time binge watching Naruto series. 

Around 2.45pm I was allowed inside the DMV office. There you recieve a ticket with ticket number. I had to wait again for close to 2 hours. Luckily there were seats so I got to rest my legs. 

It was a exhausting day but atleast I could renew my driving license. I was so hungry that I could eat a horse. I went to Popeyes to order fries, chicken sandwitch, coleslaw & a diet coke. The food was awful barring the diet coke. I made my way back to my home using uber. After I reached home, I collapsed on my bed for a quick nap.
