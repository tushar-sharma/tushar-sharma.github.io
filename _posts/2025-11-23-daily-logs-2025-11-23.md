## El Vocho and Ambassador

I was playing Forza Horizon 5. I came to know about **El Vocho**. Once very popular car in mexico. In india, we had ambassador which were ubiquitous. It was the symbol of everyday life.

Vocho were also used by taxis as it was easy to maintain. However it's no longer used in Mexico.
