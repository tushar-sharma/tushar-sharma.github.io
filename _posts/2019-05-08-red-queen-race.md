Lewis Caroll was not only a wolrd famous children's writer but also a mathematician. Hence it's not surprising to find intriguing logics in his writings. One such writing that I stumbled upon was an incident that appears in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass. 

<blockquote>
"Well, in our country," said Alice, still panting a little, "you'd generally get to somewhere elseâ€”if you run very fast for a long time, as we've been doing."

"A slow sort of country!" said the Queen. "Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!"
</blockquote>
