Lewis Caroll was not only a wolrd famous children's writer but also a mathematician. Hence it's not surprising to find intriguing logics in his writings. One such writing that I stumbled upon was an incident that appears in Lewis Carroll's Through the Looking-Glass. 

<blockquote>
"Well, in our country," said Alice, still panting a little, "you'd generally get to somewhere elseâ€”if you run very fast for a long time, as we've been doing."<br><br>
"A slow sort of country!" said the Queen. "Now, here, you see, it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. If you want to get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!"
</blockquote>

Leigh Van Valen, an evolutionary biologist, proposed Red Queen hypothesis that captures arms race between co-evolving species. Coevolution leads to situations where the probabily of extinction is relatively constant over millions of years(Van Valen 1973). In tightly coevolved interactions, evolutionary change of one species could lead to extinction of other species. The longer evolutionary history is neither better adopter or less adapted. So evolution doesn't have a progressive quality. The species thus have to run(evolve) to remain in the same place (extant)<sup><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>.
