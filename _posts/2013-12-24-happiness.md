<p>I walked miles on my feet and hope,  <br>
against all weather, people and slope, <br>
But after some distance I could not keep, <br>
enough pace as the way was steep.<br>
</p>

I was already late not by months but years, <br>
still I dragged my feet amidst all fears, <br>
at night when the moon swept the tides away, <br>
I dreamt of my past till sleep made me her prey.<!-- truncate_here -->

I walked miles on my feet and hope, <br>
against all weather, people and slope, <br>
But after some distance I could not keep, <br>
enough pace as the way was steep. <br>

I was already late not by months but years, <br>
still I dragged my feet amidst all fears, <br>
at night when the moon swept the tides away, <br>
I dreamt of my past till sleep made me her prey. <br>

Where was I up to ? What did I yearn? <br>
for there are left enough experiences to earn, <br>
I was no genius, king or noble soul, <br>
But that never deter me to walk towards my goal. <br>

Often in way people inquired about my way, <br>
"There are better players than me", all would say, <br>
I must but forget since the goal is too high, <br>
and I lacked the skills to fly to the sky. <br>

It's still early to lay to test, <br>
my faith before I finally rest, <br>
Only God knows if I could ever harvest, <br>
the crop of happiness without remorse or pest <br>
