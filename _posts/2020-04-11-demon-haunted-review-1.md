<p>This is my Part 1 of the review of the Carl Sagan's book, Demon Haunted World. This is more of my commentary rather than review of the book. </p>

I have begun to realize how many posts in Facebook, Whatsapp, etc contains puedo science & misinformation. Few posts are easy to debunk. A magic water curing cancer is no-brainer. However other posts are too meticulate to debunk. I thought it might be fruitful for me as layman to learn critical & skeptical thinking from a famous astrophysicist, Carl Sagan. <!-- truncate_here -->

This is my Part 1 of the review of the Carl Sagan's book, Demon Haunted World. This is more of my commentary rather than review of the book.

I have begun to realize how many posts in Facebook, Whatsapp, etc contains puedo science & misinformation. Few posts are easy to debunk. A magic water curing cancer is no-brainer. However other posts are too meticulate to debunk. I thought it might be fruitful for me as layman to learn critical & skeptical thinking from a famous astrophysicist, Carl Sagan.  

One day, Carl Sagan is received at the airport by his driver. On learning that he is scientist, the driver is curious to ask lots of scientific quesitons? Are aliens (UFO) hiding in the Air Force Base? Was an advance civilization living in an island Atlantis only to be destroyed by the flood? Are the prophecy of Nostradamus accurate?

Carl Sagan replied that the "evidence is crummy" for all these theories. 

As an Hindu I care less about Noah's Ark or the existence of shroud of Turin. As a child I was fascinated more whether Ram Setu was natural or man-made? I saw frequent posts on my facebook on how NASA has confirmed that it's an ancient bridge. Though NASA said that its satellite photos had been egregiously misinterpreted to make this point ("The images reproduced on the websites may well be ours, but their interpretation is certainly not ours). Ram Setu is mentioned in Sanskrit Epic Ramayana (7th century BCE). Hindus believe that the structure was constructed by god Ram. 

Later I realized people of other religion did the same. Some Muslims claims that the NASA photograph of Rima Ariadaeus, the 300 km-long rift line on the surface of the Moon, confirms splitting of the moon mentioned in Quran. Many Christian claims of geological evidence of Noah's Ark in Eastern Turkey. Most Muslims would probably care about miraculous properties of [ZamZam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zamzam_Well) water. Hindus would care more about piousness of [Ganga water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges). Chrisitan would consider water sanctified by a priest to be holy. 

Every religion have their own dogmas & believes. All religions contradict each other in some way. So which religion is the truth? It's a biological accident that you were born into your religion. Some religion vigorously proselytise (like Christianity, Islam) while some dont (like Jainism).



However there are poor people in all religions. You wont become a rich as Bill Gates just by converting to Christianity. Or become Mukesh Ambani if you converted to Hinduism. Of course televengelist in all religion claims easy cure & succes if only you pray more.

Here's a thought experiment. It might be little insensitive however it's just a hypothesis. Gather one good person & one evil person of all religion on the top of skyscrapper. Throw them & let people the world pray. Prayers from the right relgion will save the person falling from the skyscrapper. He will levitate and fall on the ground unhurt. 

Of course we all know that wont happen. Laws of physics are same for everyone. Gravity doesn't care about our relgious dogmas or piousnes. Isnt science beautiful?  




Since so many pseduoscience has flooded our world, it's an great read to try to develop scientific temper. It's not easy to debunk pseduoscience so easily. A classic example is device ADE 651 manufactured by British company, ATSC. It was marketed as bomb detector. It was sold to 20 countries in Middle East with each device cost up to $60,000. Eventually fraud was debunked & it's founder, James McCormick, is now languising in jail. Now this is a complicated fraud? 

How about prophecy of Nostrodamus? As a child I believed in them religiously. I rememberd during 9/11 bombing, lots of news channel claimign to have found in somewhere in Nostrodamus? What does science says about Astrology? 

Carl Sagan is received by his river at his airport. The driver is excited to meet the scietist. Out of his curiousity , he asks him lost of questions. But none of his questions pertains to science. He is more excited with conspiracy theories and psuedo science. 

He belived that something mysterious about Nostrodamus prophecy. Also he believed that aliens are hiding in Air force base. Or there was an advanced civilication in Atlantis island that was flooded. 

Human are bias animals. It also affects us on how we consume science. A Chrisitan might be more interested if there is some scientific evidence for Noah' Ark or shroud of Turin? A Hindu, or Zorastrian might not care. A Hindu might care more about validity of Ram Setu or Pushap Viman. Any science that reconfirms his confictions or faith, he is most likely to buy it. 

Smart People can be wrong. Ptolemy was a smart man in ? century. He believed that sun revolve around the earth. Newton was a smart man. He belived that in alchemy. Kurt Wise belives that earth is literally less than 10, 000 year old. Lord Kelvin didnot believe in evolution, sun was too young, x rays were hoax, higher than heaverying metal can never fly. Smart people can be wrong. 


SO how do we know what's the truth? Scietific consensus/ 


Pray or give 500 mg of tetracylcine for cholera
pray or 500 mg of chlozapine for schirphrenia
pray or thorw the people form a skyscrapper
