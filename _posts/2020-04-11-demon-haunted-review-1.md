This is my Part 1 of the review of the Carl Sagan's book, Demon Haunted World. 

Since so many pseduoscience has flooded our world, it's an great read to try to develop scientific temper. It's not easy to debunk pseduoscience so easily. A classic example is device ADE 651 manufactured by British company, ATSC. It was marketed as bomb detector. It was sold to 20 countries in Middle East with each device cost up to $60,000. Eventually fraud was debunked & it's founder, James McCormick, is now languising in jail. Now this is a complicated fraud? <!-- truncate_here -->

How about prophecy of Nostrodamus? As a child I believed in them religiously. I rememberd during 9/11 bombing, lots of news channel claimign to have found in somewhere in Nostrodamus? What does science says about Astrology? 

Carl Sagan is received by his river at his airport. The driver is excited to meet the scietist. Out of his curiousity , he asks him lost of questions. But none of his questions pertains to science. He is more excited with conspiracy theories and psuedo science. 

He belived that something mysterious about Nostrodamus prophecy. Also he believed that aliens are hiding in Air force base. Or there was an advanced civilication in Atlantis island that was flooded. 

Human are bias animals. It also affects us on how we consume science. A Chrisitan might be more interested if there is some scientific evidence for Noah' Ark or shroud of Turin? A Hindu, or Zorastrian might not care. A Hindu might care more about validity of Ram Setu or Pushap Viman. Any science that reconfirms his confictions or faith, he is most likely to buy it. 

Smart People can be wrong. Ptolemy was a smart man in ? century. He believed that sun revolve around the earth. Newton was a smart man. He belived that in alchemy. Kurt Wise belives that earth is literally less than 10, 000 year old. Lord Kelvin didnot believe in evolution, sun was too young, x rays were hoax, higher than heaverying metal can never fly. Smart people can be wrong. 


SO how do we know what's the truth? Scietific consensus/ 


Pray or give 500 mg of tetracylcine for cholera
pray or 500 mg of chlozapine for schirphrenia
pray or thorw the people form a skyscrapper
