<p>This is my Part 1 of the review of the Carl Sagan's book, Demon Haunted World. This is more of my commentary rather than review of the book. </p>

I have begun to realize how many posts in Facebook, Whatsapp, etc contains puedo science & misinformation. Few posts are easy to debunk. A magic water curing cancer is no-brainer. However other posts are too meticulate to debunk. I thought it might be fruitful for me as layman to learn critical & skeptical thinking from a famous astrophysicist, Carl Sagan. <!-- truncate_here -->

This is my Part 1 of the review of the Carl Sagan's book, Demon Haunted World. This is more of my commentary rather than review of the book.

I have begun to realize how many posts in Facebook, Whatsapp, etc contains puedo science & misinformation. Few posts are easy to debunk. A magic water curing cancer is no-brainer. However other posts are too meticulate to debunk. I thought it might be fruitful for me as layman to learn critical & skeptical thinking from a famous astrophysicist, Carl Sagan.  

One day, Carl Sagan is received at the airport by his driver. On learning that he is scientist, the driver is curious to ask lots of scientific quesitons? Are aliens (UFO) hiding in the Air Force Base? Was an advance civilization living in an island Atlantis only to be destroyed by the flood? Are the prophecy of Nostradamus accurate?

Carl Sagan replied that the "evidence is crummy" for all these theories. 

As an Hindu I care less about Noah's Ark or the existence of shroud of Turin. As a child I was fascinated more whether Ram Setu was natural or man-made? I saw frequent posts on my facebook on how NASA has confirmed that it's an ancient bridge. Though NASA said that its satellite photos had been egregiously misinterpreted to make this point ("The images reproduced on the websites may well be ours, but their interpretation is certainly not ours). Ram Setu is mentioned in Sanskrit Epic Ramayana (7th century BCE). Hindus believe that the structure was constructed by god Ram. 

Later I realized people of other religion did the same. Some Muslims claims that the NASA photograph of Rima Ariadaeus, the 300 km-long rift line on the surface of the Moon, confirms splitting of the moon mentioned in Quran. Many Christian claims of geological evidence of Noah's Ark in Eastern Turkey. Most Muslims would probably care about miraculous properties of [ZamZam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zamzam_Well) water. Hindus would care more about piousness of [Ganga water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges). Chrisitan would consider water sanctified by a priest to be holy. 

Every religion have their own dogmas & believes. All religions contradict each other in some way. So which religion is the truth? It's a biological accident that you were born into your religion. Some religion vigorously proselytise (like Christianity, Islam) while some don't (like Jainism).

Why does evil exist in the world? People suffer in all religons. There are poor Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Jews, etc. Of course opposite is also true. There are rich Christians, Hindus, Muslims, etc. Are all atheist have pores in their body & suffering from epilepsy due to their renunciation of god? You wont become Bill Gates just because you converted to Christianity. Nor would you become a business magnate like Mukesh Ambani just because you converted to Hindusim. Of course televangelist claims otherwise.

Here's a thought experiment. It might be insensitive but hypothesis are protected under freeom of speech (I hope!). Throw one good person from all religion including an atheist from the top of the hightest skyscrapper. Ask all the priest & the people to pray earnestly. Prayers from the "only true" religion would save the person. The gravity would disappear and right religous person would levitate & reach the ground unhurt. 

You don't need to experimentally test this hypothesis. Its a common sense. Laws of physics are same from everybody. All religion people, atheist, sinners, even animals obey the laws of physics. Gravity doesn't discriminate nor does the microbes. That's every religious places , social gathering has been suspended due to Coronavirus pandemic. 

In conclusion , If a person suffers from either

|chorlera | Just Pray | Or give him 500 mg of tetracycline|
| Schizophrenia | Just Pray | Or give him 500 mg of clozapine|

Of course science is not perfect. But it's our best bet!
