<p>This is my Part 1 of the review of Carl Sagan's book, Demon-Haunted World. This is more of my commentary rather than a review of the book. </p>

I have begun to realize how many posts on Facebook, Whatsapp, etc contains pseudoscience & misinformation. Few posts are easy to debunk. Magic water curing cancer is a no-brainer. However other posts are too meticulous to debunk. I thought it might be fruitful for me as a layman to learn critical & skeptical thinking from a famous astrophysicist, Carl Sagan. <!-- truncate_here -->

This is my Part 1 of the review of Carl Sagan's book, Demon-Haunted World. This is more of my commentary rather than a review of the book. 

I have begun to realize how many posts on Facebook, Whatsapp, etc contains pseudoscience & misinformation. Few posts are easy to debunk. Magic water curing cancer is a no-brainer. However other posts are too meticulous to debunk. I thought it might be fruitful for me as a layman to learn critical & skeptical thinking from a famous astrophysicist, Carl Sagan.

One day, Carl Sagan is received at the airport by his driver. On learning that he is a scientist, the driver is curious to ask lots of scientific questions? Are aliens (UFO) hiding in the Air Force Base? Was an advanced civilization living in an island Atlantis only to be destroyed by the flood? Are the prophecy of Nostradamus accurate?

Carl Sagan replied that the "evidence is crummy" for all these theories. 

As a Hindu, I care less about Noah's Ark or the existence of shroud of Turin. I was fascinated more about whether Ram Setu was natural or man-made? I saw frequent posts on my Facebook on how NASA has confirmed that it's an ancient bridge. Though NASA said that its satellite photos had been egregiously misinterpreted to make this point ("The images reproduced on the websites may well be ours, but their interpretation is certainly not ours). Ram Setu is mentioned in Sanskrit Epic Ramayana (7th century BCE). Hindus believe that the structure was constructed by god Ram. 

Later I realized people of other religions did the same. Some Muslims claim that the NASA photograph of Rima Ariadaeus, the 300 km-long rift line on the surface of the Moon, confirms the splitting of the moon mentioned in the Quran. Many Christian claims of geological evidence of Noah's Ark in Eastern Turkey. Most Muslims would probably care about the miraculous properties of [ZamZam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zamzam_Well) water. Hindus would care more about the piousness of [Ganga water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ganges). Chrisitan would consider water sanctified by a priest to be holy. 

Every religion has its dogmas & beliefs. All religions contradict each other in some way. So which religion is the truth? It's a biological accident that you were born into your religion. Some religion vigorously proselytizes (like Christianity, Islam) while some don't (like Jainism).

Why does evil exist in the world? People suffer in all religions. There are poor Christians, Muslims, Hindus, Jews, etc. Of course, the opposite is also true. There are rich Christians, Hindus, Muslims, etc. But is prosperity yardstick to judge the correctness of a religion? There are lots of poor nations due to colonialism & other historical reason.

Do all atheists have pores in their body & suffering from epilepsy due to their renunciation of god? You won't become Bill Gates just because you converted to Christianity. Nor would you become a business magnate like Mukesh Ambani just because you converted to Hinduism. Of course, televangelist often claims otherwise.

Here's a thought experiment. It might be insensitive but the hypothesis is protected under freedom of speech (I hope!). Gather one person from all religions of the world on the top of the highest skyscraper. And then throw them all simultaneously. Ask people of all religions to earnestly pray for the person of their religion. Correct prayers from the "only true" religion should save the persons. The gravity would somehow disappear for the right person & he will levitate & reach the ground unhurt. 

You don't need to experimentally test this hypothesis. It's common sense. Laws of physics are the same for everybody. All religious people, atheists, agnostics, hippies, sinners, even animals obey the laws of physics. Gravity doesn't discriminate nor does the microbes. That's why currently every religious place, restaurants,  social gathering, etc has been suspended due to Coronavirus pandemic. 

 If a person suffers from Cholera, you may just pray or give him 500 mg of tetracycline. If he suffers from Schizophrenia, you could just pray or give him 500 mg of clozapine. Smallpox was eradicated from the world due to science, not religion. 

I fail to understand why people romanticize the past. My mother often complains about how children in the past were more obedient. My grandfather uses to say that people lived in the past for more than a hundred years due to clean air & less pollution. I agree that pollution & global warming are a recent crisis, but I fail to see how rosy life was thousands of years ago. 

Currently, the world is engulfed in coronavirus pandemic. The best prevention for coronavirus is just using ordinary soap to wash hands for 20 seconds. I wish our ancestors knew the germ theory of diseases. Life expectancy at birth was below 30 years even as lates seventeen century.

A classic example is of Queen Anne, last Stuart monarch of eighteen century. She was pregnant eighteen times but only five children survived. Another royal example is of Mumtaj Mahal, 4th wife of Shan Jahan, Indian Mughal Emperor in the seventeenth century. She had thirteen children together. 7 of the children died at birth or at a very young age. 

If the royal families of the past had to endure the loss of their children during childbirth, it would be more gruesome for poor families. We should wonder how science has drastically improved life expectancy at birth with the invention of techniques like Cesarean delivery, vacuum-assisted vaginal delivery, etc.



Of course, science is not perfect. Science has produced grave ramifications like 
Global warming 
Nuclear weapons
Agent Orange
Nerve gas 
CFC
Thalidomide, etc

However, science is just a tool. If used constructively, it could feed easily feed people.  Science is our only bet.
