Dear Vishi, this is my daily log for Apr 25, 2023.


### VS Code

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is one of my favorite editor. It's convenient to open any project via commandline

```bash
$ cd $PROJECT
$ code .
```

Few of my shortcuts I use:

| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Cmd+Shift+F**     | Find all the files for a given string | 
| **Cmd+P**            | Find the files |
| **Cmd+Shift+P**      | Open command pallete |

### Google search 

Googling has now become synonym with searching. While usual google searches are great, however sometimes you can improve your search by using google keywords

| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **python site:github.com**     | Search python only at github.com | 
| **inurl:requirements.txt python site:github.com**            | Search python only in requirements.txt at github.com|
| **inurl:requirements.txt "python" site:github.com**            | Search exactly "python" only in requirements.txt at github.com|
| **python -java site:github.com** | Search python excluding java at github.com |
| **filetype:pdf book**              | Get result for only pdfs  | 


### Snyk

I am trying to implement `snyk` in jenkins job for serverless project. It has clouformations and pythoh code. To scan for `cloudformations`

### Startbucks

I ordered `Iced London Fog Tea Latte` at Starbucks. I modified it with only 1 pump of vanilla and light ice on recommendation of Richu. It was good and I am probably gonna stuck to this choice for some time.
