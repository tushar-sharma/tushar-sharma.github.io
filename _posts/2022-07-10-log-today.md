## Dear Vishi

### Kickboxing

Today I went to kickboxing. It's a cardio + kickboxing. I have bought gloves for kickboxing. If you ever decide to try kickboxing, remember to use wraps on your hands. It's very important as it will help you to prevent hand strain. I had a injury in my hand previously when I did not use hand wraps. 

Here is the video of hand wrap. 

### Meditation 

I have started meditation. I am still using `Satva` app on my phone which help me to meeidate for 20 minutes.
