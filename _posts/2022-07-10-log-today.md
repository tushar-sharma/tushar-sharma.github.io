### Kickboxing

Today I was supposed to go to kickboxing class. I got ready before I confronted with the horror. I couldnt find my keys. So I frantically searched for keys but all in vain. I got into ninja mode of cleaning my room. Partitoned the clothes according to color, collected all electronics items at one corner, vaccummed the carpet, cleaned up the litter under the bed. Unfortunately time elapsed before I found the keys. So I couldnt go to kickboxing class today.  

## Music 

Currently I am listening to news songs that I discovered on interent . 

Eminem (Without  me).

The Bare necesisties.


## Cooking

Today I cooked braccali in Instapot. I purchased braccoli florets from the grocery. Put water in instapot with braccoli and pressure cook for 0 minutes.


## Mock test

Today I gave a mock test on programming.
