## Dear Vishi

### Missed Kickboxing

Today I was supposed to go to kickboxing class. I got ready before I confronted with the horror. I couldnt find my keys. So I frantically searched for keys but all in vain. I got into ninja mode of cleaning my room. Partitoned the clothes according to color, collected all electronics items at one corner, vaccummed the carpet, cleaned up the litter under the bed. Unfortunately time elapsed before I found the keys. So I couldnt go to kickboxing class today.  

### Meditation 

I have started meditation. I am still using `Satva` app on my phone which help me to meeidate for 20 minutes.

## Music

I am listerning to bear necessity.
