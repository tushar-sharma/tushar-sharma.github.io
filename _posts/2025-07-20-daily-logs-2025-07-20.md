Dear Vishi, my logs for today.

## How to write a good prompt

I listened to Jonathan Mast who advised on how to write a good prompt. He said instead of writing it ourself, we can use LLM to write it for us:

>ðŸ’¬ Act as a Prompt Engineer, review the following prompt for me. optimize it to make it better and ask me any questions before proceedings: Your rough draft

## How to open `wsl` folder on File Explorer

In your terminal, you can simply type `explorer.exe .`. Or you can also go to address bar of the Explorer and type `\\wsl$`. 

## Run Java like a Python script

JBang lets you run Java files like scripts, similar to how you run Python files. No project setup, no pom.xml, no build tools needed.

Install it using `sdkman`

```bash 
sdk install jbang
```

Create a simple standalone script

```java
//DEPS io.projectreactor:reactor-core:3.6.5

import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        test1();
    }

    public static void test1() {
        Flux<Integer> nums = Flux.just(1, 2, 3, 4);

        nums.map(i -> i * 2)
            .collectList() // Converts to Mono<List<Integer>>
            .subscribe(result -> System.out.println("Doubled values: " + result));
    }
}
```

Run it like 

```bash
jbang Test.java
```
