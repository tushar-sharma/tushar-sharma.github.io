Dear Vishi, my logs for today.

## How to write a good prompt

I listened to Jonathan Mast who advised on how to write a good prompt. He said instead of writing it ourself, we can use LLM to write it for us:

>ðŸ’¬ Act as a Prompt Engineer, review the following prompt for me. optimize it to make it better and ask me any questions before proceedings: Your rough draft

## How to open `wsl` folder on File Explorer

In your terminal, you can simply type `explorer.exe .`. Or you can also go to address bar of the Explorer and type `\\wsl$`. 

## Udacity's Blockchain Developer course

What's a **blockchain**? It's a immutable distributed ledger. Blocks forms a chain and are combined by their previous hash value, that's why it's a blockchain.

What's a **trusted 3rd party**? Traditional systems rely on central authorities to 

1. Maintain authoritative ledgers

2. Validate transactions

3. Resolve disputes

4. Prevent double spending


**Double spending problem**: Digital money is just dataâ€”can be copied and spent multiple times.

**Transaction Flow**:

1. Transaction Creation: User creates and signs transaction with private key

2. Broadcasting: Transaction propagated to network nodes

3. Mempool: Unconfirmed transactions pool at each node

4. Block Assembly: Miners select transactions (usually highest fees first)

5. Mining: Solve proof-of-work puzzle to validate block

6. Block Propagation: Valid block broadcast to network

7. Confirmation: Block added to chain after network acceptance

**What'a hasing**: Bitcoin uses SHA-256, a deterministic, one-way cryptographic hash function.

```
Given an arbitrary x string

f(x) = fixed length unique value
```

1. Deterministic: same input always yields same output.

2. One-way: infeasible to compute x from f(x).

3. Collision-resistant: two different inputs shouldn't yield same output.

**what's a block**. It has

1. Transcation data

2. Previous block hash (to connect)

3. Block's metadata

```
Block Header:
â”œâ”€â”€ Previous Block Hash (32 bytes)
â”œâ”€â”€ Merkle Root (32 bytes)  
â”œâ”€â”€ Timestamp (4 bytes)
â”œâ”€â”€ Difficulty Target (4 bytes)
â”œâ”€â”€ Nonce (4 bytes)
â””â”€â”€ Block Body: Transaction List
```

**Merkle Root** is a single hash representing all transactions in the block. Built via a Merkle Tree, where each leaf is a transaction hash and parent nodes are hashes of child pairs. Enables efficient verification (logâ‚‚(n)).

```
Root Hash
      /          \
   Hash AB      Hash CD
   /    \       /     \
Hash A Hash B Hash C Hash D
  |     |       |      |
 Tx A  Tx B    Tx C   Tx D
```

**Nonce**: A number used once, iterated by miners to find a hash that meets the required difficulty target. Without the correct nonce, the hash wonâ€™t meet the blockâ€™s difficulty condition.

**Dificulty level** A dynamic target value that defines how hard it is to mine a block. Represented as the required number of leading zeroes in the hash.

## Run Java like a Python script

JBang lets you run Java files like scripts, similar to how you run Python files. No project setup, no pom.xml, no build tools needed.

Intall it using `sdkman`

```bash 
sdk install jbang
```

Create a simple standalone script

```java
//DEPS io.projectreactor:reactor-core:3.6.5

import reactor.core.publisher.Flux;

public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        test1();
    }

    public static void test1() {
        Flux<Integer> nums = Flux.just(1, 2, 3, 4);

        nums.map(i -> i * 2)
            .collectList() // Converts to Mono<List<Integer>>
            .subscribe(result -> System.out.println("Doubled values: " + result));
    }
}
```

Run it like 

```bash
jbang Test.java
```
