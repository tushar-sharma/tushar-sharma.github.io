## List comprehension in Python

List comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python. The basic syntax is:

```python
[expression for item in iterable]
```
* **expression**: This is the value that will be added to the list. It's usually some operation or transformation applied to item.

* **item**: This is the current element being considered from the iterable.

* **iterable**: Any Python iterable like a list, tuple, string, etc., from which item values are taken.
