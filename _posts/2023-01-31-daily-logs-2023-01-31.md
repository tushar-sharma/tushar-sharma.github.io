## Mustard is missing

I am aboslutely bewildered on how Mustard managed to escape from the cage. He's missing for a whole day now. The apartment is closed so it looks unlikely that he would have escaped to outside world. 

Update: I found Mustard after 24 hours. He was hiding in the closet of my roomate's room. I wanted to give him punishment but I guess he was tired and hungry so I let sneak into this cage quietly and fed him food.

## React JS

Lets say you want to fetch list of project form a GET endpoints.

```jsx

  import axios from 'axios'

  const [projectOptions, setProjectOptions] = useState([])

  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get("http://localhost:8080/projects")
        .then(res => {
          console.log(res);
          setProjectOptions(res.data.map(item => ({value: item, text: item})))
        })
  }, [])

  console.log(projectOptions);

```

## Pull Request

Sometimes git pull request showing commits that are already in target branch. One solution is 

```bash
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout feature-01
$ git rebase origin/master
$ git push --force-with-lease
```
