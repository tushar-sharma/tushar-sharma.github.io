## React JS

Lets say you want to fetch list of project form a GET endpoints.

```jsx

  import axios from 'axios'

  const [projectOptions, setProjectOptions] = useState([])

  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get("http://localhost:8080/projects")
        .then(res => {
          console.log(res);
          setProjectOptions(res.data.map(item => ({value: item, text: item})))
        })
  }, [])

  console.log(projectOptions);

```

## Pull Request

Sometimes git pull request showing commits that are already in target branch. One solution is 

```bash
$ git fetch origin
$ git checkout feature-01
$ git rebase origin/master
$ git push --force-with-lease
```
