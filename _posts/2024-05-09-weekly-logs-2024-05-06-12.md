Dear Vishi, this is my weekly logs from May 6 to May 12, 2024.


## Snapshot of my habits

## Argentina

Learned how `Yerba mate` is the national drink of Argentina. Would love to try this one time.

## Renting a Scotter in Cozumel 

I rented a scooter for 24 hours in Cozumel for 450 pesos. There are many shops offering rentals at every nook and corner. The rental agent asked for my U.S. driving license and also required credit card details for security. They tried to push for insurance, but I declined. Upon returning the scooter, you are expected to completely fill the gas tank.
