A high-fiber diet is generally not recommended during episodes of acute diarrhea because it can potentially worsen symptoms. Fiber is known to add bulk to the stool and promote regular bowel movements, which is typically beneficial for maintaining healthy digestion. However, when diarrhea occurs, the goal is to reduce the frequency and looseness of bowel movements.

Fiber-rich foods, such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes, can be harder to digest and may increase the frequency of bowel movements in individuals with diarrhea. They can also cause bloating, gas, and abdominal discomfort, which can be uncomfortable during this time.

During episodes of diarrhea, it is generally recommended to follow a low-fiber diet that includes easily digestible foods. The BRAT diet, which stands for bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast, is a commonly suggested approach. These foods are low in fiber and can help firm up the stool.
