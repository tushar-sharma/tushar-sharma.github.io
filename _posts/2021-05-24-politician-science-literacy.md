# Why do we need science temper in politician?

I belive scientific temper is important for both masses as well as politicians. 

I believe scientific literacy is important for both masses & politicians. Pushpa Bharghav made efforts to include "scientific temper" in India's constitution. Perhaps Indian consitution is the only constition in the world which explicitly mentions "a duty" to develop scientic temper. 

But what's scientific temper? 

Before we answer that question, let's talk about Margaret Thatcher. She was a famous British prime minsiter. She is called "Iron Lady". During her time a controversy erupted with regards to CFC. CFccs are chlorinated


India is currently battling second wave of Covid. Indian news is flooded by people asking for hospital bed or oxygen. India's already frailing healthcare system seems to be collapsing. In these challenging times, scientific literacy is scarce resource among India polticians. 

Margaret Thtatcher was a British prime minister. She had studied chemistry under the tutelage of Nobel Prize laureate Dorothy Hodgkin. Thomas Midgley Jr had earlier developed a chemical, called CFC (chlorofluorocarbons). CFC is a non-toxic refrigerant gases that was used to make safe refrigerators. It was popular as  DuPont brand name Freon.


High concentration of Ozone gas is found in startoshere. Ozone layer helps absorb Sun's ultraviolet light which are harmful for life on earth. CFC chemical when released are broken by ultraviolet radiotion releasing chlorine atoms. The chlorine atom which breaks the ozone molecule. 

DuPont, world's largest producer of CFC,

### Tokyo Narita International Airport

1. No transit visa required.  A quick passport and ticket check was all that was required.

2. Best toilets in the airport. Loved the advanced bidet features.

3. Got boarding pass just one hour before departure. I requested seat change to window seat and was given one at the rear. However, the airline was not crowded, so I had complete row to myself.

### Garuda Indonesia airline

1. Boarded Garuda airline from Narita International Airport to Bali, Indonesia on Airbus A330-300.

2. The meal service included one main meal post-takeoff and an ice cream before landing, along with beverages. The food quality was average.

3. There were inconsistencies with the flight tracker's arrival times, which changed a few times during the flight.

4. Found the in-flight entertainment selection limited in terms of movies and TV shows. The touchscreen was less responsive, and the absence of a headphone jack was a bummer.

5. Without Wi-Fi access (even not available for purchase), I spent some time reading "Logics of Science" by Karl Popper.

7. The safety video was pretty cool.
