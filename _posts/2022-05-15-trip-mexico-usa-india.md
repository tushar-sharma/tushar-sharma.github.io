I am travelling from Mexico city to India via Chicago, US. 


# In Mexico

You need to take a covid antigen test to be able to fly to United States. You can take the test at the airport. Go to termainal 1, Gate 6. The cost of the test is 700 pesos. You can pay with your credit card. It takes usually 30 minutes to 3 hours to get the result. The result is sent as a pdf to your email.

# Boarding the flight


I boarded the United flight from Mexico city to Chicago. United States requires transist visa for connecting flight. If you are in H1b visa, you do not need a transit visa. 

At the immigration, I was asked following questions: 

1. Which year did you do Masters? From which university? 

2. Which company do you work for? When did you start working there? 

3. Home address where I live in the United States

4. How much cash I was carrying?

Next you need to ORD airport, exit the customs and get into the trains for termainal 1.
