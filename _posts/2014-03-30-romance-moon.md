Often we meet,<br>
Avoiding prying eyes secretly,<br>
In between stretches a velvet sky,<br>
Only gulf in between us apparently.<!-- truncate_here -->

Often we meet,<br>
Avoiding prying eyes secretly,<br>
In between stretches a velvet sky,<br>
Only a gulf in between us apparently.<br>

High tides doth comes,<br>
As she tries approaching me,<br>
And sweeps the earth below,<br>
Posing as the one, only she could be.<br>

Out of the window I gaze,<br>
Shooting stars falls before her grace,<br>
While the rest clings to the sky,<br>
In a hope that to her they could embrace. <br>

Of many suitors I am one,<br>
Not noteworthy yet I whisper in hope,<br>
That by chance she could pay heed,<br>
To my melancholy heart that mope. <br>

At times I hear her throbbing heart,<br>
With waxing and waning of her sight,<br>
Into the puddle of fluffy clouds,<br>
She plays flute of her moonlight.<br>

I have seen her new,<br>
And also at times when she grows crescent, <br>
Often craters mars her luminescent face,<br>
Yet her smile always remains pleasant. <br>

I have seen the winds steal her pride, <br>
Of melody whilst she floats,<br>
Around the lonely orbit of life,<br>
Like me while the life gloats.<br>

How similar are we?<br>
And miles away she glow,<br>
How dissimilar are we?<br>
If only we could meet to know.<br>

What awaits us now,<br>
Is only a mystery of time,<br>
Will the Fate make us one?<br>
Or our love will be a mournful chime? <br>
