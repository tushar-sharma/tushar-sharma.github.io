Dear Vishi, this is my weekly logs Mar 17 to Mar 23, 2025.


## Snapshot of my habits

{% include habits.html %}

## Amazon DocumentDB

DocumentDB AWS is fully managed mongo compatible database. It replicates data six times across three Availability Zones (two copies per zone) for durability.

When connecting to DocumentDB, you can specify read preferences in the connection string:

```
mongodb://host:port/database?readPreference=primaryPreferred
```

### primaryPrefered

- have read-after-write consistency (reads reflect the latest writes)

- Reads are routed to the primary instance by default.

- if the primary is unavailable, reads shift to replicas.

- Not ideal for read-heavy workloads, as it centralizes traffic on the primary.

### secondaryPreferred 

- Reads are directed to replica instances first.

- May return stale data (eventual consistency).

- Optimizes for read scaling and high availability

### neutral

-  Lets the driver decide the optimal node based on latency or network proximity



## Langauge Devil May Cry 5

Change language in `Devil May Cry 5`. Go to the installation folder. Find the file `steam_emu.ini` and update the langauge

```

## Missing Microsoft visual c++ runtime on Steam Deck 

When running  `Non-Steam` games on steam deck, you might encounter following error:

```
Following componet are required to run the program microsoft visual c++ runtime . steam deck proton experimental
```

- Go to `Desktop Mode`

- Use `Discover` to install `ProntonTricks`

- For me I got this error while intalling **SIFU** . So search for `Non-Steam Shortcut: Sifu.exe:` and wait

- `Select the default wineprefix` -> `Install a Windows DLL or component` -> `vcrun2022`
