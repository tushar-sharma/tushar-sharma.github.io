## Lost my way out

I went to a volleyball meetup on Friday. As usual, I relied heavily on my smartphone for navigation—even though it had just 1% battery left. I plugged it into my car charger and started driving, but using Apple Maps drained the battery completely.

When my phone died, I kept driving, hoping it would power back on soon. After 30 minutes with no luck, I pulled over, waited 15 minutes, and decided to turn back. Just as I took a U-turn, the phone suddenly revived! Relieved, I followed the directions to the meetup.

I returned home around 9 PM after playing. But when I tried to check my phone, it froze completely. The screen was unresponsive—I couldn't press any buttons or even shut it down. 

With my phone still dead, I began driving home, relying solely on road signs. Thankfully, I had cash and gas to manage any detours. As I neared UNC, my phone miraculously connected to the car's Bluetooth when Richu called. She knew the university area well and guided me back safely.

**Lesson learned:**

- Force-restart an iPhone without the screen: Hold the volume up, then volume down, and keep pressing the power button

- buy a offline GPS maps? Any suggestions
