Anecdotal Travel Tips for Smart Flying.<!-- truncate_here -->

Anecdotal Travel Tips for Smart Flying.


## Early Check in 

Check in 24 hours before your flight to avoid overbooking risks and secure preferred seating. Many airlines allocate unclaimed seats to standby passengers just before departure, so early check-in ensures your spot.

## Check if you need visa? 

[traveldoc.aero](https://www.traveldoc.aero/) allows you to check if you need visa for your destination. It also helps to check if you need transit visa.

## Ear pain

I have started getting ear pain recently. Mostly it's during take off and landing. Few things have helped me alleviate the pain 

* Chew gum or suck on ginger candy to stimulate swallowing (opens Eustachian tubes).

* Use filtered earplugs (e.g., Flents Quiet or Alpine Sleepsaver) to gradually equalize pressure. Currently I use these from [MUDEELA](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K2T3XRX).

* Try the Valsalva maneuver : Pinch your nose, close your mouth, and gently blow to pop your ears.

## Seat Selection

### Comfort

* **Less turbulence**: Seats near the wings or front of the plane are closer to the aircraft’s center of gravity, reducing perceived motion.

* **Long flights**: Wear compression socks to improve circulation and lower DVT (deep vein thrombosis) risk.

* **Sleep better**: Pack a 100% blackout eye mask (e.g., Manta Sleep Mask ) for better sleep

### Safety

Recently crash of Air India flight  AI171 , Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, almost killed everyone onboard . The sole survivor was seated in 11A , a window seat near an emergency exit[^tweet]. While not a guarantee, sitting within 5 rows of an exit improves evacuation odds. Here is the [seat map](https://www.seatguru.com/airlines/Air_India/Air_India_Boeing_787-8.php) of the plane.

This case highlights how seat location might influence outcomes, though survival depends heavily on the accident type. Intriguingly, some analyses indicate that first-class seats may statistically correlate with slightly lower survival rates in crashes compared to rear economy seats—possibly due to their forward positioning. A small consolation for economy passengers: Don't feel bad for being in 'cattle class'.


## Portable travel bidet


Personal hygiene preferences vary, but a portable bidet enhances cleanliness mid-flight. Bidets I use

* Electronic [bidet](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DYYKVRH) 

* Non-electronic [bidet](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DYYKVRH)


## Entertainment

* **Read**: A Kindle is ideal for books (no glare, lightweight).

* **Watch**: Download movies on an iPad via Netflix or Prime Video (downloads usually expires like 48 hours).

* **Listen**: Bring noise-canceling headphones—airline-issued earbuds rarely deliver quality sound.

* **Game**: A Steam Deck provides offline gaming versatility for long hauls.

## Food

* **Avoid alcohol** : Dehydration at altitude amplifies hangover effects.

* **Tomato juice**: Studies suggest umami flavors intensify at 35,000 feet, making tomato juice taste richer.

* **Skip carbonated drinks**: Gas expands in low-pressure cabins, potentially causing bloating or discomfort.
