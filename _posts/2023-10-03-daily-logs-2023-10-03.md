Dear Vishi, this is my daily log for Oct 3, 2023.

### Shingles

I was talking to my collegue during lunch who told me about shingles. He previously worked in some litigation law firm. He said that stress on his previous job caused him shingles. 

This is the first time I heard about shingles. What the heck is that and how is related to stress? 

Shingles is a painful rash caused by viral infection that means it's caused by a virus and not bacteria. It's nothing but a chickenpox virus which is also called varicella-zoster virus. If it's a same virus, then why have two different names?

Chickenpox is a primary infection. It usually occurs in childhood. Symptoms include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, and a characteristic itchy rash. The rash starts as red spots which become raised and then form fluid-filled blisters. These blisters can spread all over the body. 

Once you've been infected with the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) — the virus responsible for chickenpox — the virus doesn't completely leave your body. After the active chickenpox infection resolves, the virus becomes dormant and retreats to nerve cells near the spinal cord and brain, where it remains for the rest of a person's life.


Shingles is a reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus that has been dormant in the nerve cells since a person had chickenpox.

Comparissons:

* While both diseases are characterized by a rash and are caused by the same virus, they are different conditions. Chickenpox is a primary infection, while shingles is a reactivation of the virus.

* Chickenpox tends to be more generalized and can spread throughout the body, whereas shingles is localized to a specific area on one side of the body.

* The pain associated with shingles can be quite severe, often described as burning or stabbing. Chickenpox is primarily itchy.

* Shingles can lead to post-herpetic neuralgia, a persistent pain that can last for months or even years after the rash has cleared.


What causes reactivation? Stress can be a trigger for shingles in some individuals. When a person experiences significant stress, their immune system may weaken, making it less effective at keeping the varicella-zoster virus in check. Anecdotal evidence of my collegue also confirms that stress can cause shingles.

This is one more reason not to take stress in life.
