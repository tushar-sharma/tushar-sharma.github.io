Dear Vishi, this is my daily log for Oct 3, 2023.

### Shingles

I was talking to my collegue during lunch who told me about shingles. He previously worked in some litigation law firm. He said that stress on his previous job caused him shingles. 

This is the first time I heard about shingles. What the heck is that and how is related to stress? 

Shingles is a painful rash caused by viral infection that means it's caused by a virus and not bacteria. So antibiotics can't work on shingles. It's nothing but a chickenpox virus also called varicella-zoster virus. If it's same virus, why not call it just chickenpox?

If a person earlier had chicken pox, then the virus effectively lives in his body for the rest of his life dormantly. But it can reactivates again later in his life. 

What causes reactivation? Stress can be a trigger for shingles in some individuals. When a person experiences significant stress, their immune system may weaken, making it less effective at keeping the varicella-zoster virus in check. Anecdotal evidence of my collegue also confirms that stress can cause shingles.

This is one more reason not to take stress in life.
