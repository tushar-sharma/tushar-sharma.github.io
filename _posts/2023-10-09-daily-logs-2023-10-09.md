## How to create copyToClipboard in Angular

Lets create a component `clipboard.html`. This should have button which on click changes picture from `clipboard` to `check`.

```html
<ng-template *ngFor="let link of links">
  <button *ngIf="link.copied ? Copied : Copy">
  </button>
</ng-template>
```

In `component.ts`. 


```ts
export class clipboard {
  readonly links = [
    {'dev': 'link1', 'copy'},
    {'env': 'link2', 'copy'}
    ];
}

copyToClipboard():void {
  ngIndicator.write(url).write(()-> {
    env.copyText = true;
  }, 2000);
}
```
