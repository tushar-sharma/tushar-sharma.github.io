It feels great to sleep at night. I have a small but a cozy room. It’s not lavish or splending. It doesn’t even hoard much furniture. However it’s as peaceful as it can get.

I wonder about those unfortunate people who couldn’t sleep at night. Some of them are stuck in war-torn countries. Around 150 million people are homeless in the world. Astonishing 1.6 billion people don’t have proper housing. That’s 20 percent of the entire human population.<!-- truncate_here -->

My parents were living on a rented house when I was born. Had they been poorer, I might have dewelled in some slum. How did I escape the abject poverty? It was a biological accident that I had a pre-natal privilege. Around 1 in 50 people are born with genetic disorder in the world. I again won a gene lottery to escape pangs of this misfortune. All men are created equal, if only they had some lottery of genes & privileges.

As a kid I once went with my father to a far relative to spend a few days. Their house was close to the railway stations. Every hour or so  I could hear the loud whistle of the train breezing past. I couldn't sleep for those days. Once I was back to my home, I slept like a sloth & dreams were like manna from heaven. I wonder how people slept in such apartments?

Currently I sleep in my apartment at night without the annoyance of traffic or train. Though I fear burglary, but not enough to lose my sleep. I believe sleeping without fear is a human right. It’s a privilege that I am grateful everyday.
