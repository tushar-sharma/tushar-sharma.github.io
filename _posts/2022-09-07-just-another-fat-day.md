It was just another day for Tomesh. "I just feel like a cog in a capitalist society just existing". Unlike tides which are pulled by the moon, Tomesh happiness is hinged to the sun. The sunset is when his happiness peaks. At sunset he leaves his work and return home. 

He's from Ireland. However he never set his foot on the country of his birth, he is now assimilated in American society. His day is monotonous. He wakes up early to drive to work , toils hard and then return to his chambers.  

He has gained weight in highest proportional. After work, he's reluctant to go to the gym. I'ts  just another fat day in his life.
