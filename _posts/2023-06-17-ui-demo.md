## Create a UI dashboard using React

### installation

```bash
$ npm install -g create-react-app
$ npx create-react-app ui-demo
$ cd ui-demo
$ npm start
```

### Explore React app

Main files and folders generated by Create React App:

1. **src/:** This directory contains your React components and application code.

2. **public/:** This directory contains the HTML template and static assets for your app.

3. **package.json:** This file includes the dependencies and scripts for your app.


That's the basic scaffolding.
