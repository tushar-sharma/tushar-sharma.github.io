## Windows Tinting

I am thinking of tinting my car's windows. First I learnt about VLT? In a nutshell, a lower vlt means, more darker it's. However there are various tinting limit across many states.

First draft:

- Windshield = 70% or 60% 

- Eyebrow 5%

- Driver and passenger side with 50% 

- Rear window (leave it out for now)
