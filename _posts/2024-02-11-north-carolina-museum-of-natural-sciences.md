I went to North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences on a damp morning with Richu and her mom. There is no entrance fee and the street parking was easy to find. I was particularly enamored with the fossils of dinosaurs and whales which are pretty humongous. There's also a cafe inside if you get tired from walking. Below are some of the highlights of my visit.<!-- truncate_here -->
