## how do I consume message using kcat?

Ensure that kcat is installed on your system. If not, you can find installation instructions in the [kcat GitHub repository](https://github.com/edenhill/kcat

**Prepare your SASL Authentication details**: You'll need your SASL username and password, as well as the mechanism (typically PLAIN or SCRAM-SHA-256/SHA-512).

```bash
$ kcat -C -b broker1:9092,broker2:9092 -t <topic> \
       -X security.protocol=sasl_ssl \
       -X sasl.mechanisms=SCRAM-SHA-512 \
       -X sasl.username=<username> \
       -X sasl.password=<password> \
       -X ssl.ca.location=<path_to_ca_cert> \
       -o -1 -e -J
       
json
{
  "topic": "sample-topic",
  "partition": 0,
  "offset": 12345,
  "tstype": "create",
  "ts": 1626894728000,
  "key": null,
  "payload": "{\"eventType\":\"EVENT_TYPE\",\"source\":\"SOURCE_SYSTEM\"}"
}
```

Here : 

```
-o -1: Start consuming from the latest message
-e: Exit after the last message is received.
-J:  Output the message in JSON format, including metadata such as offset, partition, and timestamp.
```

To publish , you can 

```
echo '{"key":"value", "anotherKey":123}' | kcat -P -b broker1:9092,broker2:9092 -t <topic> \
    -X security.protocol=sasl_ssl \
    -X sasl.mechanisms=SCRAM-SHA-512 \
    -X sasl.username=your-username \
    -X sasl.password=your-password \
    -X ssl.ca.location=/path/to/ca.pem
```

For larger or more complex JSON payloads, consider using a file or another program to generate the JSON and pipe it into kcat.
