Dear Vishi, this is my weekly logs from Feb 5 to Feb 11, 2024.


## Snapshot of my habits

{% include habits.html %}

## Notes

### Gradle Cache

I was testing if the gradle cache pod I deployed was successful or not. So a `Makefile` is convenient way to test different endpoints

```markdown
ping:
    @echo "Pinging $(url):5071"
    @curl -sw '\n' --fail-with-body --show-error
```

And then you can test it like 

```bash
$ make ping url=http://localhost
$ make ping url=http://some/server
```

### Gradle 

To locate your Gradle installation, you can use the where command:

```bash
$ where gradle
/opt/homebrew/bin/gradle

```

Inspect the symbolic link to find the current Gradle location:


```bash
$ ls -l /opt/homebrew/bin/gradle 
/opt/homebrew/bin/gradle -> ../Cellar/gradle/8.5/bin/gradle
```

To manually update Gradle, download the new Gradle version and move it to the location found above. For example, if /path/to/new/gradle is the location of your downloaded Gradle folder:

```bash
$ mv /path/to/new/gradle ../Cellar/gradle/8.5/bin/gradle
```

### HEIC to JPG

On Mac you can convert heic images to jpg format

```bash
$ brew install imagemagick
$ magick convert foo.HEIC foo.jpg
```
