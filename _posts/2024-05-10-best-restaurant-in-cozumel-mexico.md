During my week-long stay in Cozumel, I explored numerous restaurants. However, it was not until the last day that I discovered a true gem, leaving me with the sole regret of not finding it sooner.

## Things I liked about this restaurant:

* Firstly, its location, far removed from the tourist hub and ferry terminal, resulted in a more affordable dining experience, with prices around 150 pesos.

* Despite its small size, the restaurant was not crowded, which added to its charm.

* It gave complimentary water which was surprisingly lacking in other restaurants.

* Food was delicious and host was nice.
