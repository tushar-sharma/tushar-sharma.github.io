Sample data:

| class | name | occupation| age | 
| <50 K | Alex | teacher   | 23  |
| >50 K | Bob  | doctor    | 52  |


The column which we want to predict is called a target variable. like for e.g. column: **class** is an target variable. 

Age is a **numerical value** where as **occupation** is a **categorical value**.

Features is the number of columns minus target variable. So it would be 3 features for this sample.
