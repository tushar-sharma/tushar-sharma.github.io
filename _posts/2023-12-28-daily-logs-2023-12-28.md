Dear Vishi, daily logs for Dec 28, 2023

I went to gym today. I always have this mental block where I try to skip the gym. But after the gym I feel good about the rest of my day. I have stopped looking at the weighing machine. If your sole goal is to lose weight, then you probably gonna lose motivation by looking haplessly at fluctuating weighing machine. Being healthy should be a primary objective. Losing weight should be side effect. I read that overweight person that exercises regularly will outlive the skinny person who never exercises. Of course exercise is no excuse not to focus on weight loss. Obesity is still root of lots of diseases.

### Kafka

#### Consumer

Consumers read data from topic. Each consumer belongs to a specific consumer group, identified by a unique group id. Topics in Kafka are divided into partitions. Partitions allow for the data within a topic to be split and stored across multiple nodes in a Kafka cluster, enabling parallel consumption and providing fault tolerance.
 
When a consumer connects to a broker (bootstrap server), it's essentially connecting to the entire Kafka cluster. This is because Kafka brokers work together to create a distributed system, and any one broker can serve as the entry point to the system.

In a single partition, a consumer reads records in the order they were produced. However, with multiple partitions, consumers in the same group can read from different partitions in parallel, substantially increasing the overall read throughput.

If you have only two partition in a topic then : 

1. If you have three consumers with same group id (means they belong to same consumer group) , only two of them will be active, each consuming from one partition.

2. If you have three consumers with different group id, all three will be active.

If your goal is maximize paralleism and throughput, it's beneficial to have at least as many partitions as there are consumers.

#### Consumer Offset

Kakfa stores the offset at which a consumer group has been reading. The offset is commited in kafka topic named `__consumer_offsets`.

#### Producer

When a producer publishes to kafka topic without a key, it uses a round-robin strategy to distribute the messages evenly accross all partitions. This means that the first message goes to the first partition, the second message goes to the second partition, and so on. When the last partition is reached, the next message goes back to the first partition, hence the term "round-robin".

When a producer uses a key, each key is hashed and hash is used to determine the partition to which the message needs to be sent. Ë‡This ensures that all messages with same key always end up in same partition to maintain the order.
