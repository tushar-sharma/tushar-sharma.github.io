Dear Vishi, daily logs for Dec 28, 2023

I went to the gym today, overcoming a common psychological barrier that often discourages regular exercise. Research has shown that maintaining a routine of physical activity, like regular gym visits, can significantly improve mental well-being. A study published in The Lancet Psychiatry (2018) found that individuals who exercised had 43.2% fewer days of poor mental health compared to those who didnâ€™t exercise.

I've also shifted my focus away from constantly monitoring my weight. Fixating solely on weight loss can be counterproductive, as noted in a study from the University of Minnesota (2006), which found that frequent self-weighing was associated with negative outcomes like depression and decreased body satisfaction. Instead, adopting a holistic approach to health is beneficial. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) emphasize the importance of viewing weight loss as a beneficial side effect of a healthy lifestyle rather than the primary goal.

Regarding the impact of exercise on longevity, a study in PLOS Medicine (2015) reported that overweight individuals who are physically active have a lower risk of mortality than normal-weight individuals who are inactive. This underscores the importance of regular physical activity, regardless of body weight.

However, it's crucial to acknowledge that exercise alone isn't a comprehensive solution for weight management. The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified obesity as a significant risk factor for numerous diseases, including heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers. A balanced approach that includes both physical activity and attention to diet is essential for overall health and well-being.

### Gradle

Gradle uses `GRADLE_USER_HOME` environment variable to determine where to store its cache and configuration files. So in our groovy pipeline we can set it like 

```groovy
pipeline {
    environment {
        GRADLE_USER_HOME="/home/jenkins/.gradle/${env.JOB_NAME}"
    }
}
```
