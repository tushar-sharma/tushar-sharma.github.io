The conundrum of caste


There something interesting about caste system in India. You cannot identify caste with any physical trait. You cannto even guess somens' caste by talkng to him. The only way you can identify caste is through his name. There you have it. Caste is entwined with name. Since most of us christiend by our parents, it's difficult to choose a name. 

What was is caste? Is it varna or jaati. It's used interchangebly.
