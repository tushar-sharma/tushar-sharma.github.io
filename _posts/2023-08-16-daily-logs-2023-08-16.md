Dear Vishi, this is my daily log for Aug 16, 2023.

### Picking a stock

It's been months since I bought any stocks. Recently I sold `$SAIC` stock. But picking a stocks is a tedious process for me. I want to invest in stock or ETF this month.

First I calculate `moving average` for each stocks and generate a [report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11WyMo0tQX6McQNdktcvpav30tlZSJg7p/view?usp=sharing).

Another filter I try use is to pick stocks with dividend. Even if the stocks plummet in its value, you can still grow your portfolios by `reinvesting dividend`.

### Commute to office

It takes me almost 30 minutes to reach to office. Most of the time I am stuck at morning traffic. I have few options how to utilitze this time while on car

1. Call home (talk to parents at Indian time)

2. Listen to music (I have a personal audio collection in Google Drive)

3. Listen to audiobooks or a podcast.

4. Watch a movie.

5. Listen to pink/white noise.

6. Learn spanish.

Watching a movie always make me nervous as it may not be legal to watch while drive. Even audiobooks distracts me while driving. I have sleep apnea so I don't like talking to anyone in the morning. If I was commuting on a train, I would probably add reading. So it boils down to these choices. 

1. Listen to music. 

2. Listen to pink/white noise. 

3. Learn Spanish.


### ESPP contribution

An employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) is a company-run program in which participating employees can purchase company stock at a discounted price.

I have contributed 7% of my paycheck. I will need to read more about it to understand more.

### Badminton

I played Badminton today at Marion Diehl Recreation Center and Indoor Pool. I have to learn to hone my skills in dropping shot. I am trying to learn from this tutorial:

### Time Based Key-Value Store

#### Problem statement

Design a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple values for the same key at different time stamps and retrieve the key's value at a certain timestamp.

Implement the TimeMap class:

TimeMap() Initializes the object of the data structure.
void set(String key, String value, int timestamp) Stores the key key with the value value at the given time timestamp.
String get(String key, int timestamp) Returns a value such that set was called previously, with timestamp_prev <= timestamp. If there are multiple such values, it returns the value associated with the largest timestamp_prev. If there are no values, it returns "".

#### First Attempt

{% template  customCode.html %}
---
id: 1860d33b9fc700c49c0d5dbd1cc348dc
file: Solution1.java
---
{% endtemplate %}

It failed with error : Time Limit Exceeded. 


#### Second Attempt

Instead of using List, I can try using `TreeMap`. A TreeMap is a Red-Black tree-based NavigableMap implementation that stores keys in sorted order.

{% template  customCode.html %}
---
id: 1860d33b9fc700c49c0d5dbd1cc348dc
file: Solution2.java
---
{% endtemplate %}

 We use the `floorEntry` method of the TreeMap to get the closest timestamp lower than or equal to the requested timestamp. 

 Consider a TreeMap with the following key-value pairs: {1: "a", 3: "b", 5: "c"}. Let's assume you call the floorEntry method with the argument 4. Since 4 is greater than 3 but less than 5, the method will return the entry with the key 3 and value "b".
