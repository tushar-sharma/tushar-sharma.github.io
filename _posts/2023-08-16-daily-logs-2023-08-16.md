### Picking a stock

It's been months since I bought any stocks. Recently I sold $SAIC stock. But picking a stocks is a tedious process for me. I want to invest in stock \$ ETF this month.

First I calculate at the moving average for each stocks. I have generated this [report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11WyMo0tQX6McQNdktcvpav30tlZSJg7p/view?usp=sharing) and will analyze it.

### Commute to office

It takes me almost 30 minutes to reach to office. Most of the time I am stuck at morning traffic. I have few options how to utilitze this time while on car

1. Call home \& talk to parents who are in Indian time.

2. Listen to music. I have my own personal collection on google drive.

3. Listen to audiobooks.

4. Watch a movie.

5. Listen to pink/white noise.

6. Learn spanish.

Watching a movie always make me nervous as it may not be legal to watch while drive. Even audiobooks distracts me while driving. I have sleep apnea so I dont like talking to anyone in the morning. So it boils down to these choices.

1. Listen to music. 

2. Listen to pink/white noise. 

43. Learn Spanish.


### ESPP contribution

An employee stock purchase plan (ESPP) is a company-run program in which participating employees can purchase company stock at a discounted price.

I have contributed 7% of my paycheck. I will need to read more about it to understand more.
