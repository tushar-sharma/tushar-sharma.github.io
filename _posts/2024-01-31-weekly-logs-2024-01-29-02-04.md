At a casual lunch, my colleague told me an intriguing story of "Typhoid Mary". Mary Mallon was an Irish immigrant who worked as cook in the United States during the early 20th century. Many of those who ate her meals, fell ill yet she remained unaffected.

Mary was a carrier of Salmonella typhi, the bacterium responsible for typhoid fever, hence the moniker "Typhoid Mary." She was a asymptomatic carrier. This means that although she carried the bacteria and could transmit it to others, she did not exhibit any symptoms of the disease herself.

Mary Mallon's saga took a dramatic turn when she was arrested and quarantined by the health authorities. However, she contested her confinement and was eventually released on the condition that she would not return to her previous profession. Unfortunately, Mary violated this agreement and resumed her work as a cook, which led to further outbreaks of typhoid fever.

Why do some people are asymptomatic and some are not? Even with SARS-CoV-2, some people remained asymptomatic.

What's the difference between virtual machine and docker?

Virtual Machine includes a full fledged Operating System (OS) that runs on a software layer that manages resources called **hypervisor**.

Docker on other hand, share the host machine's kernel but operate in isolated user space. Docker relies on on lightweight images that include only the necessary components, resulting in faster deployment and more efficient utilization.

### Spanish

If I say,

	tu me partiste el corozon
    
It means you broke my heart. But If I have to say like

	tu me rompiste me vaso?
