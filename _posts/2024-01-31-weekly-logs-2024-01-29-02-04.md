## Jan 31, 2024

Got recommendations to visit Yellow Stone national park from my collegue. Would add this to my travel list. 

Read about Thyroid Mary today. She was a carrier of thyroid but never herself got stick. She was imprisoned because she was the only cook and the people around here were getting sick. 

Purchased `qcom` today based on my analysis last time. Not sure how good is that investment. Probably gonna invest in `voo` for the remaining money I have in my account.
