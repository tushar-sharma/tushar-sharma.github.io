I have a desktop for gaming, but ever since I got the Steam Deck, my gaming time has quadrupled. It's remarkable how well it handles even demanding games—it's like a Kindle for gaming. While the default SteamOS mainly supports games from the Steam store, you can actually play almost any game on the device.<!-- truncate_here -->

I have a desktop for gaming, but ever since I got the Steam Deck, my gaming time has quadrupled. It's remarkable how well it handles even demanding games—it's like a Kindle for gaming. While the default SteamOS mainly supports games from the Steam store, you can actually play almost any game on the device.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the steps, ensure you have the following:

1. **Steam Deck**: Fully updated to the latest firmware.

2. **PC**: A computer to transfer game files (optional, but recommended).

3. **Wi-Fi Network**: Both your Steam Deck and PC should be connected to the same network.

4. **Terminal Access**: Familiarity with basic terminal commands is helpful.

5. **Game Files**: The non-Steam game files you want to install.

## Enable Desktop Mode

The Steam Deck runs on a custom Linux-based operating system called SteamOS. To add non-Steam games, you’ll need to switch to **Desktop Mode**.

1. **Power On** your Steam Deck.

2. **Hold the Power Button** until the power menu appears.

3. Select **Switch to Desktop** to enter Desktop Mode.

Once in Desktop Mode, you’ll have access to a full Linux desktop environment, allowing you to install and configure software.


In Desktop Mode, open the **Konsole** terminal (found in the Applications menu).
