1. Carbonated water simply means water infused with CO2

2. Isn't CO2 bad for you since we exhale CO2 gas. 

3. According to American Herat Associate (AHA), human body doesnot need any additional sugar to function healthily. So taking any additional sugar is futile. 

4. CO 2 reacts with water to create weak carbonic acid. 

5. The ph of carbonated water is 3-4 (acidic). Can it make the stomach acidic? 

6. Does it effect enamel ?

7. Is there loss of calcium ? 

I guess moderation in anything is the mantra.
