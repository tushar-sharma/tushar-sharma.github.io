As I was walking down the isle of a foor mart, I stumbled upon sparkling water. Intrigued I bought it just for experience. 

I googled what sparkling water was. It's a water infused with carbon-di-oxide (CO2) under pressure. 

As I opened the can, it had fizzy texture. I actually enjoyed it. Despite zero calories, I wanted to understand if there's any adverse effect for drinking carbonated water. 

First I needed to understand the chemistry,

H2O + CO2 -> H2CO3 ( carbonic acid)

Carbonic acid is weak acid which means it dissociates into two ions (H+ and HCO3â€“) and anything that furnishes proton ion in a solution is considered as the acid in nature. So the proton ion gives us the sour taste.

As a kid I read about acid rain. Normal rainfall is acidic with a ph of 5.6. This is due to the fact that co2 dissolves in water forming carbonic acid. The rain becomes more acidic when it reacts with other gases in the atmosphere such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides.  Most carbonated water has ph level of 4.5. 


So is carbonic acid in sparkling water cause erosion of teeth? I havent found any conclusive study to suggest that plain carbonated water is harmful to teeth. However  drinking sparkling water with a meal or rinsing your mouth with plain water after drinking it is good dental hygiene.

1. Carbonated water simply means water infused with CO2

2. Isn't CO2 bad for you since we exhale CO2 gas. 

3. According to American Herat Associate (AHA), human body does not need any additional sugar to function healthily. So taking any additional sugar is futile. 

4. CO 2 reacts with water to create weak carbonic acid. 

5. The ph of carbonated water is 3-4 (acidic). Can it make the stomach acidic? 

6. Does it effect enamel ? So the equation is 

CO2 + H2O -> H2CO3 (carbonic acid).

7. Is there loss of calcium ? So the theory is that phosphate (phosphoric) acid used to enhance flavor of carbonated drinks interferes with the bone metabolism. However I haven't found any study that conclusively proves this theory.

8. One study on mice shows that carbonated water increase hunger hormone grehlin. [^hunger]. However sample size of study was small..


I guess moderation in anything is the mantra.
