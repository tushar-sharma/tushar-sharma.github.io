As I was walking down the aisle of a food mart, I was consumed with guilt about whether or not to buy a large can of coke. My waist is competing with inflation as both refused to halt their progress. I have thrown my weighing machine in the thrash as she refuses to lie at least once about my weight.<!-- truncate_here -->

As I was walking down the aisle of a food mart, I was consumed with guilt about whether or not to buy a large can of coke. My waist is competing with inflation as both refused to halt their progress. I have thrown my weighing machine in the thrash as she refuses to lie at least once about my weight.

According to American Herat Associate (AHA), the human body does not need any additional sugar to function healthily. So taking consuming any additional sugar is futile. Also, sugar drinks increase the risk of many diseases like diabetes, colorectal cancer, etc.

However, humans are not programmed to ignore their tastes. Luckily my eyes stumbled upon sparkling water. What the hell is that? I took it home for the experience.

A little bit of googling made me feel like a genius. So I decided to call my mother and told her about the carbonated water.

Mom, guess what I am drinking these days. 
</li>

<li class="shared sent">
What are you drinking?
</li>

<li class="shared received">
I am drinking Sparkling water. It's just water infused with carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) under pressure. It has no calories but a fizzy texture that feels like you are drinking coke.
</li>


<li class="shared sent">
Beta, but why are you drinking CO2? Isn't it bad? Don't we exhale CO<sub>2</sub> from our bodies? 
</li>

</ul>

I had no answer. So I told my mom that I will call back. I tried reading more and called my mom again.

  Mom, let me tell you why carbonated water is different than CO<sub>2</sub> we exhale.
  </li>
  
  <li class="shared sent">
  Tell me.
  </li>
  
  <li class="shared received">
  I am not consuming CO<sub>2</sub>. It has no effect on the quantity of the CO<sub>2</sub> in the blood. The carbonic acid decomposes into CO<sub>2</sub> gas and it burped out. 
  </li>

  Why not drink O2 drink then?
  </li>

  <li class="shared received">
  O<sub>2</sub> has low solubility in water. Why should I drink oxygenated water if the tap already  has oxygen in it? 
  </li>
  
  
  <li class="shared sent">
  Did you read about any harmful effects of carbonic acid?
  </li>
  
  
  <li class="shared received">
  CO<sub>2</sub> dissolved with rainfall due to pollution can cause breaking of walls called weathering. So carbonic acid might have some effect on enamel. However, I haven't found any website that say conclusively that it's bad for teeth.
  </li>

  <li class="shared sent">
   Don't drink it too much then?
  </li>

  <li class="shared received">
  Moderation is the mantra. I think other sugar drinks have far more adverse effect on teeth and bones. The phosphoric acid in the drinks can interfere in the bone metabolism. Plain sparkling water doesn't have phosphate.

  What else did you read? 
  </li>

  <li class="shared received">
  One study on mice shows that carbonated water increase hunger hormone grehlin<sup><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>. However, the study was done on a very small set of people.

  Don't become too fat. And find some time to do Yoga.
