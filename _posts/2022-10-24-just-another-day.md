## Just Another Day

Dear Vishi,

These are the series of letters where I try to log anything interesting happen on that day in my life. I might be tempted to take some creative liberty in recollecting the events. However the sole aim of this exercise is to preserve the memories which would eventually be swept into oblivion by the current of time.
