## Getting started with CommandLineRunner

CommandLineRunner interface is used to run a code block only once in a application's lifetime after application is initialized.

We can use it using `@Component`.

> Quiz: what's a component annotation?

```java
@Component
@Slf4j
public class ApplicationStartupRunner implements CommandLineRunner {
    @Override
    public void run(String... args) throws Exception {
        log.info("ApplicationStartupRunner started...!");
    }
}
```

> Quiz: explain the syntax `String...`. how's is it different than `String[] args`
