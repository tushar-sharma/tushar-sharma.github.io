## Angular

`getProject` in Angular is used to make a `GET` request. The function is asynchronous and returns a Promise, which is resolved or rejected based on the response from the server.

```js
const project = await getProject(
  url,
  values,
  get(dependencies, 'list')
  ).catch( () => {
  toast.error(`Please add a new application `)
})
```

`await` keyword is used to pause the execution of the function until the Promise returned by `getProject` is settled.
