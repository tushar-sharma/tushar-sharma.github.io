## Angular

`getProject` in Angular is used to make a `GET` request. The function is asynchronous and returns a Promise, which is resolved or rejected based on the response from the server.

```js
const project = await getProject(
  url,
  values,
  get(dependencies, 'list')
  ).catch( () => {
  toast.error(`Please add a new application `)
})
```

`await` keyword is used to pause the execution of the function until the Promise returned by `getProject` is settled.
 
 ## Spring boot
 
 You can publish your localhost within your intranet. In your `application.yaml`
 ```
server:
  port: 8080
  address: 0.0.0.0
 ```
 
 and then you can go to your IP address like on browser :
 
 ```
 http://10.16.8.110:8080/
 ```
