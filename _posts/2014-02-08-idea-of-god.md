I was lying under the open sky watching the clouds scudding by. And the trees stretched their boughs trying to reach the rainbow that ran across the sky. Suddenly the whole place was torpedoed. The Machiavelli alarm pulled me out of my dreams. My drowsy eyes glance out of the window. The sun was yet to crawl up the sky. But the enough brightness had diffused into the sky. I flung open the door and stood before my balcony.  <!-- truncate_here -->

I flung open the door and stood before my balcony.  </p>

<p>Across my building was a roof that I spotted. The wind was blowing briskly.  My wandering eyes caught the sight of a nomadic cat. She leapt across building and finally rested on the roof. At my sight she stood still. A moment passed and gust of wind passed by. Seeing her motionless aroused my curiosity. A few distance away was another building. There hung a piece of cloth which occasionally fluttered with the wind. Before me stood a motionless cat and fluttering cloth. After some time swept, came a lady who took the cloth away. And the cat soon after disappeared into oblivion. And that was left was an empty roof and me. </p>

<p>It dawned to me that roof was akin to a portrait. A moment ago it had the tinge of a cat and the cloth. After some time the brush of life has wiped them away from the portrait. Life itself appeared like a mammoth portrait with each one us resembling different strokes of color only to eventually swept away by the current of time.</p>

#### Paradox of Choice

After regaining consciousness and relinquishing my bed, I decided to stroll out in the morn. I quickly slipped into my pyjamas and shoes. The sky had the company of a dwindling moon who looked upset at the ascending sun. Occasionally birds chirped and bade the moon goodbye. The winds descended and raced with me to keep me company. 

Pavements on Indian roads are designed with nefarious motive. A person walking on them needs to master the art of maneuvering. Sometimes you may encounter among other things cows, stray dogs, two-wheelers and sometimes wandering people. After meandering through myriad streets, I came across a divergence on a street. I stood still and soon sweat started pouring down my face along with some thoughts. I was stuck with a choice however trivial. And I wondered what are my odds that I make a right choice?

Whenever I retrospect I wonder if everything that ever happened to me was a part of a grand design. If a man abuses his power, does the law of 'dharma' prevails? 'Dharma' in many religions is consider to be actions that keep the order of things in the universe. It is the cosmic law and order. 

But when I introspect all I see around is randomness. It looks life life is rolling a dice and the events that happen is a matter of chance. Though this notion makes me believe in 'free will', but robs me of belief that the god in the stars could affect my life. 

Are our choices completely random? Or the randomness but a mere illusion confined within this cosmic world. This bewilderment makes me recall a famous quote from Macbeth. 

<blockquote>
Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player, that struts and frets his hour upon the stage, and then is heard no more; it is a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing. - Shakespeare

#### Curious case of religion

The early humans learnt the art of hunting. The discovery of fire and invention of wheel are two remarkable event in the history of mankind. Man began to cling to religion as he survived the hostile environment. When a sudden thunder could usher fear, religion came to the rescue. Most of the religions have a myths to explain worldly events. The absence of rainfall could be attributed to the angry gods craving sacrifice. Also religion made man feel privileged than the rest of animals. 

<blockquote>
God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him - Gen 1.27
</blockquote>

My purpose is not to authenticate or refute any religious belief. I believe religion as a private affair. People like Spinoza have long argued separation of Church and state, though some countries are still plagued by religious fundamentalism. 

Most of the religion rely on miracles for indoctrinating people. Indoctrination robs people of questioning authority. Countless innocent people have been prosecuted in the name of religion like Bruno and Galileo. 

But what is miracle? Is talking to someone over long distance over phone miracle? It's not since in this century most of us are taught how technology works. But if I could time travel to medieval past and reveal to them an ordinary phone, they might held me in high reverence. One century's magic is another's century's science. 


#### Chicken or the Egg


In the 'Allegory of Cave', Pluto describes gathering of people who have lived all their lives inside cave facing a blank wall. When they see projections of shadows on the wall of things in front of the fire, they give name to them. Then one day a cave men escapes. He is freed and begin to understand the shadows. Man have long tried contemplating his surrounding.


Imagine if you were a fish born and raise in aquarium. You would have no idea of the world outside the aquarium. Your awareness would have been restricted within the peripheral of the aquarium. If I were to ask you then, “where did the aquarium came from”, you would have been bewildered.

Our situation is quite akin to that of fish. We live in a bigger aquarium of three spacial and a time dimension universe. If I were to ask you, "where did the universe came from", you could only surmise.

Chicken or the egg is the causality dilemma. Both can't come independent of each other. Similarly it's difficult to fathom beginning of universe since at the end something must come out of nothing. 

Most scientist believe that the answer to the chicken and egg paradox lies in quantum fluctuation which states that conservation of energy could be violated if the time is small. Hence something can come out of nothing. 

#### Beginning to understand the world

Earlier people believed that earth was flat. Eratosthenes, ancient Greek mathematician, came to the conclusion that earth was spherical. When he travelled to Syene, he saw the sun rays were vertical as they didn't cast any shadow on a bar. When he travelled to north of Syene to Alexandria, he saw that the sun rays casted shadow on the same bar. This could only happen if the earth was not flat. 


Most people believed that earth was the center of the universe. This was based on the system devised by Claudius Ptolemy and favoured by the Church of Rome. But Nicolus Copernicus, a Renaissance mathematician and astronomer, came up with a heliocentric model of the universe. He stated that sun and not the earth was the center of the solar system. 


Building from the foundation of works of Kepler and Galileo, Newton formulated laws of gravity. This gave us insight of the physical model of the universe.

People still believed in the axioms of the Euclidean geometry. A simple example of it would be that sum of all angles of a triangle would always be 180. But this view was about to be shattered. 

Reimann first came up with the idea that space is curved. Einstein, a patent clerk, revolutionize science with his theory of General Relativity. This gave a unified picture of gravity and space and time.  To understand it, think of universe as a trampoline where objects could roll. The curves or warps produced are directly proportional to energy or momentum of matter present. It gave a completely new picture of the universe.

Doppler had conjured way to calculate frequency of two distant objects. Using this concept, Hubble extended and applied it to our own galaxy. He saw that the galaxies are in fact moving apart. If we reverse the steps, we came at a point of infinite gravity, called singularity. 

The discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation in 1965 confirmed the authenticity of Big Bang theory. These are result of light from ancient stars which has been scattered by galactic dust. 


#### Anthropic Principle

If I ask why does it rain, most of us would feel insulted on being ask such a trivial question. A kid in the five standard could very well compose in the following words, “It rains because the water from different parts of earth evaporate into water vapours. The vapours rise up as they are lighter than air which in turn condense into water which fall as rain”.

But if flip the question and instead ask does it rain so that all the living being on earth could live, most of us would find it difficult to reach conclusion. This is called anthropic principle. Does the physical laws of the universe is compatible with conscious life that observes it? Why does the distance between earth and sun is optimum to sustain life? Why the optimum size of moon helps earth not to wobble? Had the precise values of fundamental physical constants not what they are, the whole universe would simple collapse in itself.


#### Ultimate truth

I once encountered two pretty girls who I presumed were Christian missionary. They asked me if they believed in Jesus. I replied in affirmative and said, 'I believe in Jesus, Krishna or any other Higher Being there is'. 'But there can be only path to ultimate truth', they revolted. This made me recall a reply by Swami Vivekanada on which religion is true.

<blockquote>
As so many rivers, having their source in different mountains, roll down, crooked or straight, and at last come into the ocean --- so, all these various creeds and religions, taking their start from different standpoints and running through crooked or straight courses, at last come unto Thee.
