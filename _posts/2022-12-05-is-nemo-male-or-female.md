Dear Vishi

Unless you were living under a rock, it's very likely that you saw the movie - Finding Nemo. I liked Marlin who was nemo's dad who faught against the odds to recover his son. Can you tell me if nemo was male or female?

That's a silly question. Of course nemo was male. But what about his dad? His dad was a clownfish. Clownfish are hermaphrodite. Hermaphrodites are organisms which have both male and female reproductive organs. All clownfish are born as males. A male fish changes to female if there is no female available. 

Do you know any other species that's a hermaphrodite? Most flowering plants are hermaphrodite. They disperse pollen as well as receive pollen. However they can also self-fertilize but plants try to avoid it because inbreeding has hamful mutation for offspring. Even in humans mating with someone close to your family lineage causes deletrious effects on offsprings.

This reminds me of a novel I read long time back called "Left Hand of Darkness", there was a planet where everyone was hermophrodite. There was no patriarchy or sexual discrimination of any sort. What do you think? Would human society be better off if everyone was a hermophrodite?


Me and Richa went to Petsmart and bought another hamster. Frostie is very engergetic in contrast to Mustard. He's always running...
