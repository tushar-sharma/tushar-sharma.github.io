That's a silly question. Of course Marlin was a male in the movie. But he was also a clownfish. Clownfish are hermaphrodite. Hermaphrodites are organisms which have both male and female reproductive organs. All clownfish are born as males. A male fish changes to female if there is no female available. 

Do you know any other species that's a hermaphrodite? Most flowering plants are hermaphrodite. They disperse pollen as well as receive pollen. However they can also self-fertilize but plants avoid it because inbreeding causes harmful mutation. Inbreeding even in humans have deleterious effects on offspring.
