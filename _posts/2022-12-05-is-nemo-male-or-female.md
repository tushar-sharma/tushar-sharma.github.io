Dear Vishi

Unless you were living under a rock, it's very likely that you saw the movie - Finding Nemo. I liked Marlin who was nemo's dad who faught against the odds to recover his son. Can you tell me if his dad was a female or a male?

That's a silly question. Of course Marlin was male in the movie. But he was a clownfish. Clownfish are hermaphrodite. Hermaphrodites are organisms which have both male and female reproductive organs. All clownfish are born as males. A male fish changes to female if there is no female available.
