Dear Vishi,

There's been lot of news regarding collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. I never heard about it. So I digged a little deeper to understand why it was a big deal. 

Silicon Valley Bank is known as bank for startups. It specializes in providing financial services and resources to early-stage and high-growth technology companies and venture capitalists. 

The SVB invested their customer's money in of securities (MBS) yield 1.56-1.66%. However Fed interest rate is at 4.57%. So this causing a bank run. 

What'a  bank run?A bank run is a situation where a large number of depositors withdraw their funds from a bank at the same time, usually due to concerns about the bank's solvency or ability to meet its obligations.

Silicon Valley Bank experienced a bank run because it had mostly uninsured deposits from startups who borrowed money from the same bank, leaving it vulnerable to a run. The collapse was due to depositors, mostly technology workers and venture capital-backed companies, pulling their money out, resulting in the bank's insolvency.
