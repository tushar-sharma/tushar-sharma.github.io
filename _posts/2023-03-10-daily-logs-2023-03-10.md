Dear Vishi,

There's been lot of news regarding collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. I never heard about it. So I digged a little deeper to understand why it was a big deal. 

Silicon Valley Bank is known as bank for startups. It specializes in providing financial services and resources to early-stage and high-growth technology companies and venture capitalists.
