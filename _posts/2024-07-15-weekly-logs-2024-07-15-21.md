Dear Vishi, this is my weekly logs from from July 15 to 21, 2024.<!-- truncate_here -->

## Snapshot of my habits

{% include habits.html %}

## FreeCycle.org

Stumbled upon this [website](https://www.freecycle.org/). Though you can hardly get anthing brand new, but sometimes you can find some good cheap recyclable stuffs.

## Crowdstrike Outrage

We were suppose to fly to Anchorage, Alaska today with Delta. The flights were delayed so we missed our connecting flight. We had to hop to MSP airport and were on a standy ticket for the last flight. The flight was almost full and we got lucky and were the last lucky members to board the flight. The flight was meh. Just served snack and a beverage in a five hour flight. 

It seems like `Crowdstrike` pushed an update which ran on kernel mode and crashed all windows machine. Airports worldwide are affected by this issue. The `crwd` stocks was also bearish. 

Crowdstrike wrote a [blog](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/falcon-update-for-windows-hosts-technical-details/) explaining what happened. There was a logic error resulting in a system crash and blue screen (BSOD) on impacted systems.
