Dear Vishi, this is my weekly logs from from July 15 to 21, 2024.<!-- truncate_here -->

## Snapshot of my habits

{% include habits.html %}

## FreeCycle.org

Stumbled upon this [website](https://www.freecycle.org/). Though you can hardly get anthing brand new, but sometimes you can find some good cheap recyclable stuffs.

## Crowdstrike Outrage

We are suppose to fly to Alaska today. However our flight is delayed and we would most likely miss our connecting flight. 

It seems like Crowdstrike pushed an update which ran on kernel mode and crashed all windows machine. Airports worldwide are affected by this issue. The stock for crowdstrike fell because of that.
