Today I walked a little further, <br>
further than yesterday.<br>
while my feet ache and plead,<br>
I dragged 'em without paying any heed.<!-- truncate_here -->

Today I walked a little further, <br>
further than yesterday.<br>
while my feet ache and plead,<br>
I dragged 'em without paying any heed.<br>

Lost in thoughts of wilderness,<br>
Caged in the civilization of life.<br>
I often stray away from a well-beaten path,<br>
only to invite a flury of ridicule and wrath.<br>

Sometimes I have a urge to pause, <br>
To glance over my shoulders, <br>
spot silhouettes of old friends,<br>
waiting to animate to make amend.<br>

Like an irreversible arrow of time,<br>
Aging sucks memories into oblivion,<br>
While the clockâ€™s hand marches ahead, <br>
it obliterates lost friends and words unsaid.<br> 

Supernova is an epitaph of a dying star,<br>
For it has splendid quanity of fuel to squander,<br>
Since I am too poor to afford a grandeur farewell,<br>
hope my lost friends still harbour my memories well.<br>
