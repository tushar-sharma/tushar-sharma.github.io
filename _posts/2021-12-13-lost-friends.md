<p>
Today I walked a little further,<br>
Few more steps than yesterday,<br>
For I love walking,<br>
And I have walked all my life.<br>
</p>

My walk is not straight,<br>
Often I stray from the path,<br>
Lost in thoughts of wilderness,<br>
Caged in the civilization of life.<!-- truncate_here -->

Today I walked a little further,<br>
Few more steps than yesterday,<br>
For I love walking,<br>
And I have walked all my life.<br>

My walk is not straight,<br>
Often I stray from the path,<br>
Lost in thoughts of wilderness,<br>
Caged in the civilization of life.<br>

Today I walked a little further,<br>
Few more steps than yesterday,<br>
For the people that I have met,<br>
Mostly I have lost them in the way.<br>

Often I have a urge to pause,<br>
To glance over my shoulders,<br>
Only if my eyes could greet,<br>
Some old friend miles yonder.<br>

But the current of life seldom leaves,<br>
Footprints of yesteryears,<br>
And all those people I knew,<br>
Dissolved into the mist of memories.<br>

As the clock's hand marches ahead,<br>
And some of my grey hair do betray,<br>
Of those, lost friends and words unsaid,<br>
Will ever, the theatre of life, portray?<br>
