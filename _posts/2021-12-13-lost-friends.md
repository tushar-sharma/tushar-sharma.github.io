Today I walked a little further,<br>
further than yesterday,<br>
For I love walking,<br>

Today I walked a little further,<br>
further than yesterday,<br>
For I love the thought of walking,<br>
despite my aching toes pleading to stay.<br>

My walk is often crooked,<br>
Not because of any lingering malice,<br>
but since gait is pigeon-toed,<br>
I often stray into dark alleys. <br>

Often I stray from the path,<br>
Lost in thoughts of wilderness,<br>
Caged in the civilization of life.<br>

Today I walked a little further,<br>
Few more steps than yesterday,<br>
For the people that I have met,<br>
Mostly I have lost them in the way.<br>

Often I have a urge to pause,<br>
To glance over my shoulders,<br>
Only if my eyes could greet,<br>
Some old friend miles yonder.<br>

But the current of life seldom leaves,<br>
Footprints of yesteryears,<br>
And all those people I knew,<br>
Dissolved into the mist of memories.<br>

As the clock's hand marches ahead,<br>
and the fountain of youth dissipates, <br>
brings blight on head's harvest,<br>
Spilling the fountain of youth<br>
Of those, lost friends and words unsaid,<br>
memories begin to dwindle under a spell of long  <br>
