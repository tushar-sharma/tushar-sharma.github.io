As a non-immigrant worker in the United States, navigating the visa stamping process can be a cumbersome task. However, with proper planning and understanding of the process, the journey can be much smoother.

If you are on a visa in the US and need to travel outside of the country, it is likely that you will need to visit your home country to get a visa stamp. This stamp is essential for re-entry into the United States. However, if you are applying for the same visa class, you may be eligible for a convenient option called "dropbox." This means that you do not need to go through the traditional visa interview process in order to obtain a US visa stamp.

Recently, I had to travel to India for personal reasons and decided to take advantage of the dropbox option. I booked an appointment at Delhi's VAC (Visa Application Center) located at the Shivaji Stadium Metro Station.

Upon arriving at the VAC center, I learned that there were restrictions on carrying a bag or luggage, except for the necessary documents. After going through security, I was able to head to the VAC center, which was three levels below ground level.

To be prepared for the appointment, it's important to have the following documents in hand:

### Documents required

1. Valid passport

2. Appointment confirmation

3. DS-160 confirmation

4. One passport photo (I got it from Walgreens in US, [size requirement](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/photos.html))

5. Employement verification letter

6. `I-797 Approval Notice` copy (Not original).

Having these documents ready ahead of time can save a lot of time and hassle during the appointment.
