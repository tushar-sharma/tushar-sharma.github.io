## Git

When you do `git status` , sometimes you want to filter some result. For example if you dont want to see `deleted` files.

```bash
$ git status | grep -v deleted
```

Here -v is for invert-search. You can type `man grep` for more detail. 

## Guinea Pig food

I stopped at Petsmart today to buy pellets for piggies. Those little cute bastards are pooping volcanoes. They even poop in their sleep. It's one of the worst thing owning a guinea pig.

I played tennis in the morning. My serves keep hitting the net. I guess I need to work on my serves. I usually do continental serve but had to switch to pancake serves when I hit too many of them.
