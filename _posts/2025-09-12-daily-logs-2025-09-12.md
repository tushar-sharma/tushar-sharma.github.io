Dear Vishi, dear logs for today.

I hate to admit it, but I lost my glasses to my own tomfoolery. I was driving to work when it started raining. Usually, I never pull my glasses out of the bag, but I forgot Murphy’s law. I noticed some dust on them and thought, “How can I clean these?” My brain farted with a “brilliant” idea: just clean them with the rain.

So I did it—driving at 70 mph, opening the window, holding the glasses out to rinse them—only for the wind to mock me and snatch them away.
