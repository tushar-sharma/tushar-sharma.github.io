Dear Vishi, dear logs for today.

## Glases

I hate to admit it, but I lost my glasses to my own tomfoolery. I was driving to work when it started raining. Usually, I never pull my glasses out of the bag, but I forgot Murphy‚Äôs law. I noticed some dust on them and thought, ‚ÄúHow can I clean these?‚Äù My brain farted with a ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù idea: just clean them with the rain.

So I did it‚Äîdriving at 70 mph, opening the window, holding the glasses out to rinse them‚Äîonly for the wind to mock me and snatch them away.

Now, I have to order my computer glasses again ü§¶. Luckily, I still have a prescription from optometrist which expires this Nov. This means I can still purchase glasses with HSA.

## Steam Deck 

Previously, I was storing my non-Steam games in /home/deck/Games. This caused problems because /home/deck lives on the small root (/) partition of the Steam Deck (about ~25‚Äì30 GB). Once that partition filled up, I couldn‚Äôt install updates or other applications, even though the SSD still had plenty of space.

The fix was to move everything to:

```
/home/deck/.local/share/NonSteamGames
```

The `.local/share` path is on the large data partition where Steam normally installs its games, so it can actually use the full SSD space.

To add non-steam games, in Dolphin file explorer, press Ctrl + H to toggle hidden files/folders so you can access `.local`.
