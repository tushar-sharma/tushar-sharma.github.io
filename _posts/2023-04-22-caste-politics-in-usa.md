I grew up in India and still unable to grasp the complexity of caste. Of course there's a caste discrimination still plaguing India. However, India is a country of billion people with diverse language, culture and prosperity have no consensus on caste. However a white professor in US, who lived all her life outside India, seems to have an expert opinion on caste.<!-- truncate_here -->

How how does one identify caste? Any Indian would tell you it's by your last name. Since antiquity last names were associated with trade and thus become de facto caste. 

But to claim that you can identify caste with `visible markers` is scientifically nonsense. Opinions are not scientific facts. There's no study that claims that caste is unique like `race`. Some of the caste activist claim that lower caste have darker complexion than upper caste. Not only this claim racist but devoid of any rational. Of course all they want is to club caste with race so that `caste` politics becomes more potent in the US. 

Some of the jewels from Thenmozhi Soundararajan, the founder of `Equality labs`[^ref1]

1. The Nazis aren't Germans in f*king Europe, they're actually Upper caste Indians

2. Every act of Hindu scripture has brought nothing but violence and pain

Caste is social construct that is archaic and needs to be dismantled. How can it be dismantled? It depends on whom you ask. Most centrist or right wing Hindus believe that Hinduism can be reformed just like Christianity. However the left in India belives that caste distmantling entails dismantling Hinduism itself. Prof Dwivedi, an IIT professor, claimed that a French-style revolution alone can help India recover from its current caste stasis[^ref2].

The California Civil Rights Department dismissed its case against two Cisco engineers who allegedly engaged in caste bias. However even before the verdict, the internation media and left/liberal media in India drew prima facie conclusion that it was a caste discrimination.

British historians like James Mill, wrote about Hindus, "under the glosing exterior of the Hindu, lies a general disposition to deceit and perfidy". Katherine Mayo in her book `Mother India` criticized India's treatment of women, the untouchables, animals, the countryside, and the character of its nationalistic politicians while opposing India's independence movement. Gandhi criticized it as "report of a drain inspector sent out with the one purpose of opening and examining the drains of the country to be reported upon". This prejudice is still prevalent in a cartoon published by New York times on India's Mars mission.
