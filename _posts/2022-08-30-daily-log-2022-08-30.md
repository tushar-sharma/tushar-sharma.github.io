## Running

Today I woke up around 6.30 AM. I decided to go to the tail for jogging. I feel running helps in lifting up the mood. According to this study [^study], endocannabinoids molecules are released by body which help regulate your sleep, mood, appetite, memory and even reproduction and fertility.
