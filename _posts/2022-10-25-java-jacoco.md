## Java JaCoCo

JaCoCo is an opensource code coverage tool for java. JaCoco runs in Java proxy mode, which is responsible for instrumenting  bytecodes when running tests. JaCoCo drills down into each instruction and displays the lines to be executed during each test. To collect coverage data, JaCoCo uses ASM to perform code instrumentation on-the-fly  and receives events from the JVM Tool Interface in the pro cess, ultimately generating a code coverage report.
