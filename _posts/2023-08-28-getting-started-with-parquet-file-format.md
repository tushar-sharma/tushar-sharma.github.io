Data can be broadly categorized into three types based on its structure: Unstructured, semi-unstructured, structured data.<!-- truncate_here -->

### Overview

Data can be broadly categorized into three types based on its structure:

1. Unstructured Data: This includes formats like CSV, TXT which don't have a specific structure or schema.

2. Semi-Structured Data: Data formats like XML and JSON fall into this category. They have a flexible schema but still maintain some level of structure.

3. Structured Data: Formats like Avro and Parquet are considered structured as they have a defined schema.

### Parquet Overview

Parquet is a popular choice for big data processing tasks, and here's why:

1. Binary Format with Efficient Compression: Parquet is a binary file format. By default, it uses the Snappy compression algorithm when used with Apache Spark, which provides a good balance between compression ratio and speed.

2. Columnar Storage: Unlike row-based files, Parquet is columnar. This means it supports column pruning and predicate pushdown, which can significantly speed up queries.

3. Optimized for WORM: Parquet is optimized for Write Once, Read Many (WORM) operations. This makes it a preferred choice for data lakes and big data processing tasks.

### How to Choose a Good Partition Column

When working with Parquet in big data systems like Spark, choosing the right partition column is crucial. Here are some guidelines:

1. Avoid High Cardinality Columns: If a column has a lot of unique values, it will create numerous directories. This leads to more overhead during parsing.

2. Filterable Columns: Choose columns that are frequently used as filters in queries. For example, if you often filter data by a specific "date" or "region", those might be good partitioning candidates.

3. Low Cardinality Columns: Columns with low cardinality create a small number of directories but each directory contains a large amount of data. This can optimize read operations.

4. Trial and Error: Sometimes, the best way to determine the optimal partition column is through experimentation. Monitor the performance of your queries and adjust accordingly.

### Benchmarking TXT vs. Parquet

Ensure you have the necessary libraries:
 
```
pip install pyspark pandas pyarrow
```
