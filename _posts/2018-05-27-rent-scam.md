Recently, my roommate, had his job contract terminated. He found a new job in another city which meant I had to hunt for a new roommate. So I quickly posted an ad on Sulekha, a popular website in USA among Indians.<!-- truncate_here -->

Recently, my roommate, had his job contract terminated. He found a new job in another city which meant I had to hunt for a new roommate. So I quickly posted an ad on Sulekha[^sulekha], a popular website in USA among Indians.

A month ago I had stumbled upon an old friend in a private birthday bash. He was raving about a rent scam. More than thousands of dollars were siphoned off his account. Barring some sympathy, I paid little heed to his story. Little did I know I would almost fell for a similar scam.

### You have a text message!


<ul class="chatlist ">

<li class="shared received">

I sent him the photos of the apartment & its details.

<ul class="chatlist ">
  <li class="shared received">
  I am planning to move in as soon as you give me the go ahead and only after payment mode has been discussed and paid. I believe you are okay with Check payment in replace of cash or online transfer? If you are pleased with the check payment then you will need to forward me your mailing address/apartment number and names to be written on the check payment
  </li>

  <li class="shared sent">
  So your total rent is $**** including all utilities. Is that k?

  </li>
</ul>

I am rarely interested in someone's personal belief or food habits unless it infringes in my personal space. But I patiently listened to his rambling. Later we talked about payment.

<ul class="chatlist ">
  <li class="shared received">
  As regard to payment to secure this unit up front to my arrival, I have a financier and he will be handling my move in cost on my behalf
  </li>
  <li class="shared received">
  Surely I clearly understand and will make payment for the utility bills in person once I arrive
  </li>

  <li class="shared received">
  I have discussed with my financier and he has agreed to issue out payment to you right away through certified cheque.

  My subsequent rent bills will be made by online transfer

I tried to match the passport with the sample published by the National Document Fraud Unit (NDFU)[^ndfu] on their website[^document]. At a cursorty glance, font does looks weird. Since I am not a forensic expert, I gave him the benefit of doubt.


<ul class="chatlist ">
  <li class="shared received">
  My financier is issuing out the cheque payment to you now
  </li>
  <li class="shared received">
The amount of the cheque which you will receive shortly will consist of both my total rent and my travel expense

<ul class="chatlist ">

  What is the extra amount?
  </li>

  <li class="shared sent">
  See if you transfer any amount to my account, it has to be exact $***, else I won't cash it
  </li>

  <li class="shared received">
  So all you have to do once you get the cheque copy is to make sure you deposit into your bank right away
  </li>

  <li class="shared received">
  I need you to please help me with this huge favor, I have closed down my account with the local bank I am using here. Since I will be relocating, will only be able to open a new account on my arrival since BOH(Bank of Hawaii) does not have other branches in other cities.
  </li>

  <li class="shared received">
  Please, this will be the only time I will make payment in this form. OK
  </li>
  <li class="shared received">

Red Flag! Hawaii is one of the states of United States. If he is already living in the USA (as he claims), he should be able to easily access his account or make an appropriate arrangement. If he was coming from another country, I might have believed him.

### How the scam works?

1. The buyer uses a cashier's check or money order. They explain that this is their only option for payment.
2. The seller or recipient gets a check for more than they asked for.
3. The seller is supposed to send the extra money back to the buyer or to a "helper"

But's here's the catch. After you deposit the fradulent cheque in the bank, the bank must provide you with the cash to withdraw within 2 business days. But it can take sometimes take more than four days for banks to verify if the cheque is genuine[^bank].

Once the bank finds out the cheque is bogus, it reverses the amount. In the meantime, if you had already transferred money to someone else, the money is lost. And now you also owe bank that transferred amount.

So far I have realized that this was a scamster. But I wanted to have some fun 😉.

<ul class="chatlist ">
  <li class="shared sent">
  So when are you sending the cheque?
  </li>
</ul>

Next morning, he replies with a flattery message.

<ul class="chatlist ">
<li class="shared received">
Good morning dear Tushar, how was your night? I hope you slept well?  
</li>

<li class="shared sent">
Not really, my pet orangutan kept me awake all night.
</li>

<li class="shared received">
Alright, please what is the update regarding the cheque payment that I sent to you? Have you completed the Mobile deposit please?
</li>

</ul>

<blockquote class="attention">
<i style="color: red; " class="fas fa-exclamation"></i>
Red Flag! He didn't ask me how come I have orangutan in my apartment. How often do people keep apes as pets ? But all he cares about is cheque deposit.

### Fun with the scammer

Now I am fabricating outlandish lies about myself to see how he reacts.

<ul class="chatlist ">
  <li class="shared sent">
Ok . I'll deposit it today. But I wanted to know more about you? Are you married ?
</li>

<li class="shared received">
Perfect and no I have never been married. I'm still single
</li>

<li class="shared sent">
Ok. Are you working full time or contract at CISCO ?
</li>

<li class="shared received">
I work full time with CISCO.
</li>

<li class="shared sent">
Are you a pure vegetarian? I sometimes eat seafood, chicken, sea-shell, duck or crave for cannibalistic desire. Is that acceptable to you?
</li>

<li class="shared received">
Sure I honestly don't have any problem with you eating habit in the unit but I'm a pure vegetarian and I don't cook.
</li>

<li class="shared sent">
Ok. I 'll deposit the cheque today after work. Also, I forgot to tell you that I practice Tantra. As a traditional Hindu myself, I sometimes practice nudity in my apartment. I hope that wouldn't bother you.
</li>


<li class="shared received">
Sure that is not a problem.
</li>

</ul>

<blockquote class="attention">
<i style="color: red; " class="fas fa-exclamation"></i>
Red Flag! He has no problem with me being cannibal or nude. He was agreeing to pretty much everything I was saying.
</blockquote>


<ul class="chatlist ">
  <li class="shared sent">
That's very nice. So what are your skills ? Do you work in JAVA / C++ , Python ?</li>

<li class="shared received">
You have asked me a million questions, please update me as soon as you deposit the cheque.
</li>

<li class="shared sent">
I asked your skills because I thought you were smart enough to earn your living without scamming innocent people.</li>

<li class="shared sent">
I hope you are not Indian because you are sullying the reputation of Indians. But in life everyone has their reasons so who am I to judge 🤷.
</li>

<li class="shared sent">
Goodbye
</li>
</ul>


### Conclusion

When we read about scams, our first reaction is to dismiss it wholeheartedly with a mere retort "How can someone by that stupid? ". But I have personally known many smart people falling to many scams like rent scam, USCIS scam, 911 scam, etc. Luckily I had met an old friend a month ago who had warned me about this scam.

> The best remedy against any scam is knowledge.
