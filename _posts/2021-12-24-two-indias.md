Letter From the Producer

My Dear Hindu Friends,

What urged me on to produce this Ramayana film was that I really sympathize with Indian philosophy. I can't help thinking that in my last life I might have been an Indian, explaining why I love India this much. During the 10 years of making the film when I sometimes worried about raising money or became troubled with aspects of the work, I was encouraged by a confidence that because I was making nothing else but Ramayana, I would have the divine protection of Rama or Hanuman. Now, the work complete, I found that my feeling was right. I appreciate the cooperation of the Indian people and I love India from the bottom of my heart.<br>

I first visited India 25 years ago, and since then many times. I have produced many documentary films about her. I journeyed all along the Ganges from its sacred source, Gangotri, to its mouth Ganga Sagar. I visited other places to learn about the Kumbha Mela and sadhus. Through my travels, I experienced Indian prayers, lives and many mysteries. This experience made me think about: a) what is the meaning of life and where did we come from; b) tenderness and firmness, adoration for nature and Gods, coexistence of humans and animals and a deep understanding for human beings which India has, and c) Japan's present condition which is much too Westernized.<br>

Wherever I went in India, I could feel that I was familiar with this land or I knew it before. It's like a memory of surprise and puzzlement when we jumped into this universe out from our mother's womb where we were crouching and drifting in dark water. It's the feeling like I want to kneel down and kiss the land. The Hindu world sometimes appears tender and evanescent and sometimes firm and timeless â€“ all the light and shadows made by souls of Indian people who feel a day of three thousands years ago like just yesterday.<br>

Sincerely,<br>
Yugo Sako, Producer Ramayana<sup>1</sup>
