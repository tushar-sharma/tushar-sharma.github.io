Dear Vishi, this is my weekly logs from Feb 19 to Feb 25, 2024.

## Snapshot of my habits

## Tom and Jerry

Tom and Jerry producer Fred Quimbly, though not involved in the creative process, took all credit for the cartoon's success. Each time hte cartoon won the Academy Award for Animated Short Film, he accepted it without inviting the animators, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. 

This reminds me of quote by Calvin Coolidge-

> Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan 'Press On!' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.

## Hinduphobia

Recently I saw a video of Slavoj Žižek, Slovenian philosopher, ranting against Bhagavad Gita which is one of the holiest book for the Hindus.

In the video, he refers to Bhagavad Gita as the "one of the most obscene disgusted sacred books (sic)". Had he directed similar criticism for other Abrahamic religions, the repercussions might have been more severe. He still has his job as International director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humantities. But bashing Hinduism has no severe backlash:

* There is no Hindu majority countries except India and Nepal. 

* Much of the left in India vehemently opposes Hindusim in guise of "dismantling Brahmanism".

This remind me a tweet by Audrey Truskey who face no repercussion for referring Rama, a revered diety in Hindusim, as [misognisitc pig](https://www.newslaundry.com/2018/04/30/the-unscholarly-dishonesty-of-audrey-truschke). Recenlty she wrote an article for the [Time magazine](https://time.com/6564148/ayodhya-ram-temple-modi-india/) on the occassion of inaguration of Rama temple in India and she continues to teach at Rutgers University. 

On contrary, consider this. In U.S, Erika López Prater, an adjunct professor at Hamline University, lost her job becasue she showed painting of Islamic art that was deemed offensive by some Muslims.

It reminds me something called Regressive left. I dont know how much it's justified, but either we should have equal freedom to criticize all religions or none. Selective criticism or censorship is a breeding ground for resentment. That's how the liberal lose their moral ground.

## MacOS Catalina(v 10.15.3): Error: “chromedriver” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified

I just ran this command from terminal to solve this error.

```bash
$ xattr -d com.apple.quarantine $(which chromedriver)
```

This deletes the `com.apple.quarantine` attribute from the chromedriver executable. This effectively tells MacOS that the chromedriver is safe and it can be run without the Gatekeeper intervention. This is why the error "chromedriver" cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified is resolved after running this command.
