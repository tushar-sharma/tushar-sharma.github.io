Dear Vishi, this is my weekly logs from Feb 19 to Feb 25, 2024.

## Hinduphobia

Recently I saw a video of Slavoj Žižek, Slovenian philosopher, ranting against Bhagavad Gita which is one of the holiest book for the Hindus.

In the video, he refers to Bhagavad Gita as the "one of the most obscene disgusted sacred books (sic)". Had he sad similar things about sacred books other religions, probably he would lose his job international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humantities. But bashing Hinduism would not have severe backlash considering there are no:

* More than fifty Hindu countries that have oil or could criticize 

* Much of the left in India vehemently opposes Hindusim in guise of attacking Brahmanism

This remind me a tweet by Audrey Truskey. She called the Rama, one the God of Hindusim, as misognisitc pig. Her defense was she was loosely translating scriptures.

She also didn't lose her job. Recenlty she wrote an article for the Time magazine on the occassion of inaguration of Rama temple in India. 

On contrary, consider this. In U.S, Erika López Prater, an adjunct professor at Hamline University, lost her job becasue she showed painting of Islamic art the some Muslims felt offended. 

It reminds me something called Regressive left. I dont know how much it's justified, but either we should have equal freedom to criticize all religions or none. Selective criticism or censorship is a breeding ground for resentment. That's how the liberal lose their moral ground.

## MacOS Catalina(v 10.15.3): Error: “chromedriver” cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified

I just ran this command from terminal to solve this error.

```bash
$ xattr -d com.apple.quarantine $(which chromedriver)
```
