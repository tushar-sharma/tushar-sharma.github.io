Dear Vishi, this is my weekly logs from Feb 19 to Feb 25, 2024.

## Snapshot of my habits

## Tom and Jerry

Tom and Jerry producer Fred Quimbly, though not involved in the creative process, took all credit for the cartoon's success. Each time the cartoon won the Academy Award for Animated Short Film, he accepted it without inviting the animators, William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. 

This reminds me of quote by Calvin Coolidge-

> Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. The slogan 'Press On!' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.
