## TemplateID in DAML

A template is similar to a class in java. In **OOP**, a class is a blueprint of an object. You instantiate a class, which creates an object that holds values in the heap. 

in **DAML**, we create a **contract**, which is an instantiation of a template. A contract is an actual value in the ledger that holds the record. 

When we create a contract, we need a templateID. The full templateID looks like this: **1234abcd...:Customer:Account`

1. **1234abcd**: The packageId (hash) of the **DAR** file. Just like a fat JAR in java, DAR files contains bytecode of compiled DAML classes. The cryptographic hash changes whenever the content of the package changes. 

2. **Customer**: The module name. In **DAML**, you define this at the top of your code

```haskell
module Customer where
```

3. **Account**: The template name. e.g.

```haskell
template Account with 
   owner : Party
   balance: Decimal
```
