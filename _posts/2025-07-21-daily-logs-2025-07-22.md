Dear Vishi, my logs for today.

## Engine Oil change

I order **syntatic oil** from [amsoil.com ](amsoil.com) for my Honda Accord 2017. It's better than **regular oil**. 

| Product                                      | Package Size   | Qty | Price   |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|-----|---------|
| AMSOIL Signature Series 0W-20 100% Synthetic Motor Oil | Quart Bottle   | 5   | $77.45  |
| AMSOIL Oil Filter                            | EA15K13        | 1   | $13.30  |

Most of the car's autoshop don't accept your own oil. I found a cheap one at **Queen city auto care & Lube at 6286 South blvd, charlotte, nc 28217**. It charges only 20 bucks for oil change.

## Things to do in long car drive

I usually commutes 5 hours every week to work. I wonder what all things I can do while driving:

1. Listening to songs 

2. learn a language

3. talk to chatGPT and ask questions

4. Watch a movie (not recommended)

5. Listen to a book (gives me a headache)

6. Listen to a podcast 

7. Talk to a friend (or family)
