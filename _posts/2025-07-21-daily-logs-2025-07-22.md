Dear Vishi, my logs for today.

## Engine Oil Change

I ordered **synthetic oil** from [amsoil.com](amsoil.com) for my Honda Accord 2017. It's better than **regular oil**. 

| Product                                      | Package Size   | Qty | Price   |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|-----|---------|
| AMSOIL Signature Series 0W-20 100% Synthetic Motor Oil | Quart Bottle   | 5   | $77.45  |
| AMSOIL Oil Filter                            | EA15K13        | 1   | $13.30  |

Most car's autocare shops don't let you bring your own oil or parts. I found a cheap one at **Queen City Auto Care & Lube at 6286 South Blvd, Charlotte, NC 28217**. It charges only 20 bucks for an oil change. That's the most reasonable I have found. Would recommend.

## Things to Do on Long Car Drives

I usually commute long hours to work. I wonder what all things I can do while driving:

1. Listening to songs 

2. Learn a language

3. Talk to ChatGPT and ask questions

4. Watch a movie (not recommended)

5. Listen to a book or a podcast

6. Talk to a friend (or family)

## Why the Sky is Blue

Today I listened to [Why the Sky is Blue by C.V. Raman](https://archive.org/details/WhyTheSkyIsBlue-English-C.V.Raman), a famous Nobel Prize Laureate in Physics from India. He delivered this lecture at the Community Science Center in 1968.

**Key insights from the lecture:**

### 1. The Chain of Questions Approach

When someone asks "Why is the sky blue?", don't just give a direct answer. Instead, ask another question: "Is the sky always blue?"

This leads us to realize that the sky only appears blue in daylight. So what's the difference between night and day? **The sun.**

Next question: But moonlight is practically sunlight reflected, yet there's no bluish color at night. So it depends on **illuminance** - the color only appears at higher light intensity levels.

Now we know that both atmosphere and sun are responsible for the color, but **how?** Next question: Does it appear more blue on clear skies or cloudy skies?

This chain of questioning leads to understanding the phenomenon at a much deeper level.

### 2. Avoid Superficial Answers

Don't give short, casual answers. For example, saying "leaves are green because of chlorophyll" is technically correct but lacks **inquisitiveness**. The real question becomes: *Why* does chlorophyll absorb certain wavelengths and reflect green light?

### 3. Light Scattering and Particle Size

Light is scattered most effectively when its **wavelength** is approximately equal to the size of the scattering particle. Think of it like resonance - a wave is more able to resonate with a piece of wood its own size rather than with a massive ship.

This principle explains why shorter blue wavelengths are scattered more by tiny atmospheric particles than longer red wavelengths.

**The key insight**: More blue light is scattered in the atmosphere due to microscopic particles and gas molecules. Without these scattering particles, there would be no blue sky - just the black void of space visible during the day.

## New Concepts

**Financial Instrument**: A legally binding contract that represents a monetary value and can be traded between parties. These instruments derive their value from underlying assets and generate future cash flows. Examples include:
- **Equity instruments**: Stocks, shares
- **Debt instruments**: Bonds, treasury bills, certificates of deposit
- **Derivative instruments**: Options, futures, swaps

**CUSIP (Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures)**: A 9-character alphanumeric code that serves as a unique identifier for securities issued in the United States and Canada. Think of it as a "fingerprint" or "serial number" for financial instruments. The format consists of:
- First 6 characters: Identify the issuer
- 7th & 8th characters: Identify the specific issue
- 9th character: Check digit for validation

## Booking a Flight for Visa Purposes

I need to buy a refundable flight for **visa purposes**. In my experience, it's better to book it directly with the airline rather than through a middleman. I booked **main refundable** from the **Delta website**.
