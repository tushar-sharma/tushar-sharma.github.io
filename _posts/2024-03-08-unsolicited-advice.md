Consider the following scenario: You're sitting on a bus when a stranger initiates a conversation. "What do you do for a living?" he asks. At this time, I was unemployed. "I'm currently in between jobs," I responded. 

"And for how long have you been seeking employment?" he probed. I generally prefer not to share too much personal information, especially with strangers. "I might consider becoming a stock broker," I replied, attempting to lighten the mood.

Seizing the opportunity, the stranger launched into a lengthy critique about the pitfalls of the stock market. He argued that even the most skilled data scientists struggle to profit, suggesting that the system is fundamentally flawed and unnecessary. 

Would this stranger be willing to pay for my lunch? "Could you please pay for my lunch at the next stop?" I requested, "I forgot my wallet at home." His tone changed, and he said that he had to leave soon. Why was he not kind enough to pay for my lunch yet so gregarious a moment ago? Did this mean his advice was worth less than a meal? I began to wonder, why are people so eager to offer unsolicited advice?

It seems humans have an inherent tendency to give advice. This behaviour can be traced back to our evolutionary roots. As primates, we are hardwired for communication, and there is a certain satisfaction in imparting wisdom. However, when asked to part with our resources, our survival instincts kick in, reminding us of the importance of self-preservation. This dichotomy explains why individuals can be generous with advice but frugal with their wallets.

However, is advice without context truly valuable? Steve Jobs famously advocated for following one's dreams after he dropped out of college. Yet, this advice may not be universally applicable. Similarly, Elon Musk has stated that attending college is not necessary for acquiring knowledge. Nevertheless, job listings at his companies, such as Tesla and SpaceX, often require a degree. 

Beware of generic advice. Many say that hard work leads to success, but if that were the case, a hardworking donkey would be the owner of the farm.

Seek advice from those who are accountable for their words. For instance, a doctor who prescribes medication can be held liable for mistakes. This form of advice is more reliable than that from a well-intentioned stranger shouting on the street.

Similarly, consider advice from those who have a vested interest in your success, such as a paid tennis coach or your parents.

In a world filled with noise, it's crucial to seek advice that carries weight, advice backed by accountability, expertise, and genuine concern.
