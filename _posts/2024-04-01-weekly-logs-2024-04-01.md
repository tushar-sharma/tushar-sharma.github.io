Dear Vishi, this is my weekly logs from Apr 1 to Apr 7, 2024.<!-- truncate_here -->

Dear Vishi, this is my weekly logs from Apr 1 to Apr 7, 2024.

## Snapshot of my habits

## Magnesium supplements

I usually take two supplements - 

1. B12 on empty stomach

2. D3 with food

Recently I cam across multiple tweets extolling magnesium supplements<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>.

First ask ourself what foods are rich in magnesium. Like nuts and seeds like almonds, cashews. Green vegetables like spinach, kale, etc. Fruits like avacado, banana, etc. Fish like salmon, etc<sup id='fnref:2'><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>.

Next, can there be excess overdose of magnesium? Too much magnesium doesn't pose a health risk in healthy individual because the kidneys  can eliminate excess amount of magnesium<sup id='fnref:3'><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup>.

Now do we need supplments if we dont have deficiency? There's a huge market for supplements so I'm skeptical in taking any supplements that is touted as a wonder pill. How many claims are made regularly made about how green tea can reduce weight, or rosemary/mustard oil can help with hair loss, etc.
