<p>Today I tried to meditate again. I used Insight Timer app for background sound. However I think I'll just stick to Youtube as it has more varieties. I struggled for 20 minutes sitting cross-legged as my mind wandered in the labyrinth of thoughts. I guess it will take more practice to hone my skill. Have you ever wondered how monks can meditate for countless hours or days?</p>

There's a very famous picture of a Vietnamese monk called [Thích Quảng Đức](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Th%C3%ADch_Qu%E1%BA%A3ng_%C4%90%E1%BB%A9c). He was protesting against the persecution of Buddhist. He self-immolated himself without making any fuss.{% include_relative tags.md %}

David Halberstam, an American journalist was witness to self-immolation said-

> "As he burned he never moved a muscle, never uttered a sound, his outward composure in sharp contrast to the wailing people around him"


People claim they can levitate while meditating. However I am not convinced if the laws of physics can be broken. Carl Sagan said, "extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence". So we can ignore mumbo jumbo of levitation. However meditation can certainly help to remain calm under tumultuous times.

Currently I am reading [Glimpses of World History](http://randomwits.com/books) by Nehru. I hope you might recall some of the history of [Mughal Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mughal_Empire). Remember history is not fact. There are multiple interpretation & nuances by different people colored by their own biases. Today I'll share views of Nehru on two prominent figure in ancient India.

Babar laid the foundation of Mughal Empire in India. Nehru praises him in his description




<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Babar was one of the most cultured &amp; delightful persons one could meet...no sectarianism in him, no religious bigotry, he did not destroy as his ancestors used to do...was devoted to art &amp; literature” -excerpt from “Glimpses of World History “, Nehru <a href="https://t.co/XpkgW8Hg9N">https://t.co/XpkgW8Hg9N</a> <a href="https://t.co/onbmEwULmc">pic.twitter.com/onbmEwULmc</a></p>&mdash; Tushar Sharma (@tshrocks) <a href="https://twitter.com/tshrocks/status/1396728857437241344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 24, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

However Nehru was critical of Aurangzeb, who was the last ruler of the Mughal Empire.


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Aurangzeb, imprisoning his old father, was a bigot, tolerating no religion but his own. He laid down policy of persecution of Hindus..reimposed jizya tax on Hindus...destroyed Hindus temples by thousand-excerpt from “Glimpses of World History” <a href="https://t.co/XpkgW8Hg9N">https://t.co/XpkgW8Hg9N</a> <a href="https://t.co/8Mf9xOzJZN"><img src="https://t.co/8Mf9xOzJZN"></a></p>&mdash; Tushar Sharma (@tshrocks) <a href="https://twitter.com/tshrocks/status/1397137200492384256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 25, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


Do you think Babar was more better than Aurangzeb? Remember history is nuanced. May be you can read more about it to form your own opinion.
