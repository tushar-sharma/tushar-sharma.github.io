## Meditation

Today I tried to do meditation again. I couldn't keep the continous streek as I missed it yesterday. I used Insight Timer on my phone to practice meditation. The tried meditating for 20 minutes. However my mind was like a nomadic tribe which made me lose focus. It's difficult to control one's mind. Have you wondered how monks could meditate for countless hours or days? 

There's a very famous picture of a Vietnamese monk called Thích Quảng Đức. He was protesting the persecution of Buddhist under the government of Ngo Dinh Diem. He has self-immoldated himself during `Buddhist crisis`.

David Halberstam, an American journalist had this to say about him 

> As he burned he never moved a muscle, never uttered a sound, his outward composure in sharp contrast to the wailing people around him

Self-immolation is an controversial topic. I will refrain from commenting about it. However meditation can certainly help someone to remain calm under tumultous times.
