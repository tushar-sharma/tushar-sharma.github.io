### Sharing highlighted code in Browser

Sometimes its useful to highlight part of code when sharing the code via browser . In `Bitbucket` , you can highlight lines by appending `#` after the url followed by line numbers. For example to highlight from line 1 to 24, you can do

```
https://${BITBUCKET}/${repo}/${file}#1-24
```

This will hightlight line 1 to 24.

In `Github` you can do similar like

```
https://github.com/${repo}/${file}#L1-L24
```

In Mac, I use `brew` for installing most of the services. 

To view a list of services

```bash
$ brew services list
```

Staring a service 

```bash
$ brew services start service_name
```

Stopping a service

```bash
$ brew services stop service_name
```

Restarting a service

```bash
$ brew services restart service_name
```
