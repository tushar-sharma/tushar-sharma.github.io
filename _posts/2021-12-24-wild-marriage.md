"Marriages are made in heaven" is an old adage quite prevalent across all cultures. Whether heaven harbors any interest in the mortal affair has still scant empirical evidence. However there is a rare marriage that not only invites heaven's fury but also is consummated by mutual suicide.<!-- truncate_here -->

"Marriages are made in heaven" is an old adage quite prevalent across all cultures. Whether heaven harbors any interest in the mortal affair has still scant empirical evidence. However there is a rare marriage that not only invites heaven's fury but also is consummated by mutual suicide. 

"Wild marriage" was coined by Max Born in his book Atomic Physics. The phenomenon describes an encounter of a positron and an electron. Both particles will cease to exist and will annihilate each other by releasing intensive electromagnetic radiation (gamma [γ] rays).

# Annihilation

Antimatter is the same as ordinary matter except that it has the opposite electric charge. Positron is an antimatter equivalent for an electron. They have equal mass but opposite charges. Thanks to Einstein's equation, **E=mc<sup>2</sup>**, there's an equivalence between energy and mass. So a colliding positron and electron converts their rest mass to pure energy in form of two oppositely directed 0.511 MeV photons.

$$
\begin{align}
  e− + e+ → γ + γ (2x 0.511 MeV)
\end{align}
$$

# Dirac Sea

There is an old Hindu story : A fish went to the Queen fish and asked: "I have always heard about the sea, but what is the sea? Where is it?" The Queen fish replied: "You live, move, and have your being in the sea. The sea is within you and without you, and you are made of sea and you will end in sea. The sea surrounds you as your own being"<sup><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>.

# Philosophical Musing 

Marriage as an institution is unique to humans. It's a legal contract with bells and whistles depending upon the jurisdiction. Dissolving a friendship has no legal consequences but dissolving a marriage requires an acquiesce of the court.


Matter and anti matter are mostly identical twins differing in charges. Our universe owes its existence to the deficiency of anti matter else it would have been annihilated. Early universe probably had copious quantities of both matter and anti-matter. However the cards were dealt in favor of matter thus creating our universe.
