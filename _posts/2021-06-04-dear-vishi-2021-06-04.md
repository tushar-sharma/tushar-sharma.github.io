Today I want to talk about an iconic photo of Margaret Hamilton. She joined the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory at MIT, which worked on the NASA's Apollo Space Mission. She played critical role in developing flight software for the missing which landed humans on moon in 1969.

> Here, Margaret is shown standing beside listings of the software developed by her and the team she was in charge of, the LM [lunar module] and CM [command module] on-board flight software team.


The code developed by Margaret Hamilton is available in public domain. If you are curious, you can look at this [Github repository](https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11). The code is written in Assembly language. There are mutliple classification of programming language. Usually computer only understand machine langugae which is obscure one zero sequence like 1010101 etc. It's difficult to program in machine language. Machine language came as a relief that provided abstractions that programmers can use to easily write code. However it's still considered low-level language. These days you often inundated with high level langauges like Python, Java, etc. which provides more abstraction that is easier for programmers to code. However every code whether Java or Assembly or any other language needs to be converted to machine executable code.
