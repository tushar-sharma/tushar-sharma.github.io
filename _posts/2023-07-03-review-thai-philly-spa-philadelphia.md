I recently found myself in need of a rejuvenating break during a road trip from Charlotte. I stumbled upon Thai Philly Spa, which was in between my trip to East Providence, RI. The spa center was anything but<!-- truncate_here -->

I recently found myself in need of a rejuvenating break during a road trip from Charlotte. I stumbled upon Thai Philly Spa, which was in between my trip to East Providence, RI. The spa center was anything but lackluster. 

I went for spa at Asian spa so I thought I reviewed it. The spa is located at 1613 Snyder Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19145. 

Another challenge I encountered was locating the spa using Google Maps. Navigating through the bustling streets of Philadelphia proved to be a bit of a struggle. The spa's address didn't align accurately with its location on the map, leaving me feeling a tad frustrated and disoriented. It would have been helpful if the spa had provided clearer directions or a more prominent presence online to ensure a smoother arrival.

The masseur was from Thailand. So I greeted her in Thai: 

<a class="speech-link speech" data-toggle="audio" data-audio-id="1">สวัสดี<span><i class="cl icon-volume-up icon-small"></i></span></a>
<audio id="1" src="{{root_url}}/sounds/สวัสดี.mp3" preload="auto"></audio>

<a class="speech-link speech" data-toggle="audio" data-audio-id="2">ครับ<span><i class="cl icon-volume-up icon-small"></i></span></a>
<audio id="2" src="{{root_url}}/sounds/ครับ.mp3" preload="auto"></audio>


<iframe
  style="position: relative; width: 100%;"
  height="400"
  src="{{ root_url }}/encrypted/{{ page.path | split:'/' | last | replace: '.md' '' }}.html"
  frameborder="0"
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
  allowfullscreen
  title="Sample"
  id="myIframe"
  onload="applyParentStyles(this)"
></iframe>


Considering these factors, I must admit that this spa might not be a place I would return to in the future. While the lukewarm massage and difficulty in finding the spa were drawbacks, it's worth noting that everyone's experience can differ. For those seeking a convenient and exceptional spa experience in Philadelphia, I would recommend exploring other options to ensure a more satisfying visit.
