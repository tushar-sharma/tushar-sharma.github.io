## God

God is the best job in the world. "God is great" is a phrase I have heard often. Most people invoke god for any good occurance in their lives. However when the misfortune strike, I have never.  heard anyone cursing God. "May be God will help pull me from my misfortune", or "just a bad luck". 

I want this God job where people praise me for any good thing that happen in their life and pray to me for anything worse. No responsiblity whatsoever.
