Cozumel, a jewel in the Caribbean Sea, is famed for its crystal-clear waters, vibrant coral reefs, and lush green landscapes. While this Mexican island offers a plethora of activities for the eager tourist, one of the best ways to explore its natural beauty and hidden gems is by renting a scooter. 

Upon arrival from the ferry, you might be tempted to rent a scooter from the first vendor you see near the ferry terminal. My advice? Resist the urge. These spots often come with a higher price tag and a crowd of touts looking to capitalize on freshly-arrived tourists. Instead, take a leisurely walk or a short cab ride further into the island, where numerous rental shops offer more competitive rates.

My initial offer for a scooter rental was 500 pesos until 7 PM. However, with a bit of haggling, I managed to secure a 24-hour rental for 450 Mexican Pesos. Based on my experience, and with a bit of persistence, you might be able to push that price down to 400 Pesos or even lower.

One of the perks of your rental will be receiving a scooter with a full tank. From my journey around the island, which covered most of the accessible roads, I discovered that only half a tank was necessary for a full day’s adventure. Keep in mind, though, you'll need to return the scooter with a full tank. This is standard practice, so plan a stop at a gas station before returning your ride.

When it comes to insurance, rental shops will likely nudge you towards additional coverage, which could add another 200 to 300 Pesos to your bill. Based on my experience, if you plan to drive cautiously (which you should), opting for just the basic insurance should suffice. It’s an island, after all, where the pace of life—including traffic—is naturally slower.

I used my U.S. license without any issues. However, make sure they return your license after copying it. There have been instances where travelers were asked to leave their license, a practice that’s unnecessary and can lead to complications. Always keep your documentation in your possession.
