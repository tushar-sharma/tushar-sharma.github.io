## Travel Guide to Mexico City

Hola. I've been to Mexico city twice. I thought it was prudent to pen down my experiences. 

## Getting there 

The airport to Mexico city is MEX. Once you land at the airport, as if May 8, 2022 requires to wear `face mask`. You need to proceed to immigration. First line is for `Mexicans` if you have Mexican passport. Second line is for other `foriegners`. You need to carry a `pen` to fill out a form given to you before the immigration desk. You need to fill both top and bottom of the form. 

If you have a `US visa` you dont need Mexican visa. But the `US visa` needs to be valid for the entire duration. At the immigration desk, they ask you total duarion fo your stay. Also they tear the form and give it back to you. You need to keep thi save when you are flying back. 

After immigration you can go to the `belt` to claim baggage. After that you need to exit. Look for the sign of `Salida`. On exit, you enter `Terminal 1`. You can find authroized taxis. If you prefer `Uber`, select `Terminal 1` and `Gate 7`.  Then walk towards the left towards gate 7.
