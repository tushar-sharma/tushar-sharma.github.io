Dear Vishi, this is my weekly logs from June 10 to 16, 2024.<!-- truncate_here -->

## June 14

### Sate Lilit

Tried chicken *Sate lilit* which is part of Balinese cuisine. It's spiced minced meat on a skewer that's grilled. It's okay and I didn't like it that much.

### Whoosh train in Jakarta

You can book ticket online via [website](https://ticket.kcic.co.id/webTrade/#/home/index). You would need your passport details to register. However I missed my first train due to traffic. Try to reach the station at least 30 minutues prior to departure. You can also book ticket at the train station and remember to carry your passport during the trip.
