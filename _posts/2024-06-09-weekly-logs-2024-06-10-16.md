### Tokyo Narita International Airport

1. No transit visa required.  A quick passport and ticket check was all that was required.

2. Best toilets in the airport. Loved the advanced bidet features.

3. Got boarding pass just one hour before departure. I requested seat change to window seat and was given one at the rear. However, the airline was not crowded, so I had complete row to myself.

### Garuda Indonesia airline

1. Boarded Garuda airline from Narita International Airport to Bali, Indonesia on Airbus A330-300.

2. The meal service included one main meal post-takeoff and an ice cream before landing, along with beverages. The food quality was average.

3. There were inconsistencies with the flight tracker's arrival times, which changed a few times during the flight.

4. Found the in-flight entertainment selection limited in terms of movies and TV shows. The touchscreen was less responsive, and the absence of a headphone jack limited personal entertainment options.

5. Without Wi-Fi access (not available for purchase), I spent some time reading "Logics of Science" by Karl Popper.

7. The safety video was pretty cool.

### Denpasar International Airport

1. Use Airola for eSIM and it worked fine.

2. Used Grab app for taxi. However local recommend Gojek for cheap alternative.

3. Paid 500,000 Indonesian Rupiah for visa on arrival's receipt. Immigration was really fast. I was only asked about duration of stay.

4. Mandatory to scan QR code at customs to declare any items.

### Bali

1. Ate dinner at Queenie Resto<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>. Ordered sea food rice which was "mas o menos". However I liked the hot ginger tea without sugar. Won't repeat.
