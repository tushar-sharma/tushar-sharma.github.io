Dear Vishi, this is my daily log for Feb 06, 2023.

## Learning spanish


| English              | Spanish                 | Comments         | 
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |-------------------|
| I like chicken       | me gusta el pollo       | pollo is poyo, gusta is to like    |
| I like the apple     | me gusta la manzana     |                                    |
| ¿Cómo te llamas?     | What is your name?      | llamas is yamas   | 
| ¿Te gusta el helado? | Do you like ice cream ? | te means you      |

1. In Spanish, it's common to start questions with "¿".

2. el is used for masculine singluar nouns, la is used for feminine singular nouns.

I came across a website called [News in Slow Spanish](https://www.newsinslowspanish.com/latino) which reads spanish slowly and with captions.
