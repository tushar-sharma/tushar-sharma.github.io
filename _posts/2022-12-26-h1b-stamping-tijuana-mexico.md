I got my H1b visa renewed and got I797 visa. However I cant travel outside the USA unless I have visa stamped. Queue in India for visa stamping is long so I am exploring other options like Mexico to get visa stamped.

So there's a term called Third Country nationals(TCNs) which is a citizen of a country other than Mexico who applies for a non-immigrant visa with their non-Mexican passport.
