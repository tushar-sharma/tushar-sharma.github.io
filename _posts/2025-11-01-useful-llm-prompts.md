List of LLM prompts that I have found useful. I will be updating this list over time.

* Act as a Prompt Engineer, review the following prompt for me. optimize it to make it better and ask me any questions before proceedings: Your rough draft

* Do a dry run of the code to identify bugs, unnecessary code or we missed anything. the code is suppose to be simple  and legible

* Do a PR review of the branch x against main. First check should have look for obvious code smells , programming bugs, anti-pattern or deviation from best practices. Do a dry run with sample data and check for the logic of the application. Secondaly, check if there's a race condition or code that's not scalable.
