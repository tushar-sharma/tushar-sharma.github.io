## Review of Arbys

I like drive-through at Arbys. My favourite goto items are:

1. **Cajun Fish Wrap**: I love fish sandwitch than other wraps. It has Hushpuppy Breaded Fish Strips with Cajun seasoning, shredded lettuce, tomato, and a zesty Cajun remoulade on an artisan wrap. The website says **750 calories**. It's not somethng that I would indulge regularly. May be once a week is fine with me.

2.**Curly Fries**: This is horrible. It's both unhealthy and tasteless. 

3. **Crinkle Fries**: This is unhealthy but taste good. Better than curly fries.

4. **Buffalo Chicken Wrap**: I would prefer fish sandwitch. THis also comes with **790 calories** as mentioned in their website. 


Bottom line is that Arbys is a fast food place. Just like any fast food place, eat in moderation.
