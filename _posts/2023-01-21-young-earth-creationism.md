I stumbled upon a youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82j1IqwA6P0">video</a> of Georgia Purdom, an American biologist and young Earth creationist. As a biologist, how can one reject the theory of evolution, the very foundation of the field?<!-- truncate_here -->

I stumbled upon a youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82j1IqwA6P0">video</a> of Georgia Purdom, an American biologist and young Earth creationist. As a biologist, how can one reject the theory of evolution, the very foundation of the field?

In a YouTube video, Purdom attempts to use scientific language to argue for the feasibility of Noah's Ark, while simultaneously claiming that the Earth is no older than 10,000 years old.

Purdom is an employee of Answers in Genesis, a far-right Christian organization that promotes the belief that the Earth is only 6,000 years old. They argue that relying on man-made dating methods, which they deem fallible and often inaccurate, leads to a range of conflicting ages for the Earth.

Here's an excerpt from their [website](https://answersingenesis.org/age-of-the-earth/how-old-is-the-earth/)

<blockquote>
When we start our thinking with God's Word, we see that the world is about 6,000 years old. When we rely on man's fallible (and often demonstrably false) dating methods, we can get a confusing range of ages from a few thousand to billions of years, though the vast majority of methods do not give dates even close to billions.
  
The age of the earth ultimately comes down to a matter of trust—it's a worldview issue. Will you trust what an all-knowing God says on the subject, or will you trust imperfect man’s assumptions and imaginations about the past that regularly are changing?

It is a testament to the words of the philosopher, George Santayana, that they selectively use science to support their narrative, while disregarding it when it contradicts their beliefs. It reminds me of Kurt Wise who had a PhD in Geology from Harvard University. He could not reconcile with modern science and his faith in Christianity. He is also an young earth creationist. 

In the words of Galileo Galilei remind us: "I do not feel obliged to believe that the same God who has endowed us with sense, reason, and intellect has intended us to forgo their use." This serves as a reminder that academic degrees do not necessarily indicate a scientific mindset, as the philosopher, Immanuel Kant, once said: "The greatest problem of our time is that the majority of educated people are still not educated."
