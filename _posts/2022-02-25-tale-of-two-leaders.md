Wars is a terrible tragedy with no winners. United States has spent more than $8 trillion dollars on the post-9/11 wars in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, and elsewhere[^usa-cost]. Soviet Union learnt a bitter lesson after spending more than $50 billion in Afghanistan[^soviet-cost]. Wars drag countries back for decades due to insurmountable economic loss. 

Sometimes war are inevitable due to geopolitics. I could not help but to compare how the president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy starkly differs from Ashraf Ghani, last President of Afghanistan before the fall of Kabul. Ukriane is fighting a much powerful country like Russia, where Afghanistan had to face the onslaught of Taliban after withdrawal of United States troops and support.

Ashraf Ghani fled

Volodymyr Zelenskyy has choosen to stay in Ukraine

Morale of the armed forces depend upon their leaders.
