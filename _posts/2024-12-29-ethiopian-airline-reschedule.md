Recently, I needed to reschedule my Ethiopian Airlines flight due to a change in plans. With just a week before departure, I was anxious about whether I could manage the rescheduling in time. Here’s how I handled it, step by step:

### Step 1: Finding the Right Contact Number

Ethiopian Airlines provides a detailed list of worldwide contact numbers on their [help and contact page](https://www.ethiopianairlines.com/in/services/help-and-contact/worldwide-contacts). Since I was in India, I initially considered calling the local number but ultimately opted to call their U.S. toll-free number for more reliable service.

### Step 2: Using Rebtel to Call the U.S. Number

To reach the U.S. toll-free number from India, I used the Rebtel app. This app is an excellent choice for making international calls at minimal cost. The number I dialed was:

**Toll-Free:** 1-800-445-2733

### Step 3: Customer Service Experience

The customer service representative I spoke with was both professional and efficient. They quickly understood my situation and guided me through the rescheduling process. Within minutes, my flight was updated to my preferred date and time.

### Step 4: Rescheduling Fee

There was a $200 fee for rescheduling my flight. Given that my original flight cost was around $1,300, I was relieved that I didn’t have to spend anywhere near that amount again. While the fee might seem high, it felt reasonable under the circumstances, and I appreciated the straightforward explanation of the charges.

Overall, the process was smooth and stress-free, thanks to Ethiopian Airlines’ efficient customer service.
