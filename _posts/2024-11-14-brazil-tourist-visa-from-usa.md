My experience in getting Brazil Tourist Visa living in the USA while having Indian passport.


First, you need to create an [online application](https://formulario-mre.serpro.gov.br/sci/pages/web/ui/#/cidadao-nacionalidade). Depending upon your passport, you may qualify for e-visa. However I had to apply for regular tourist visa. I had to upload following documents to successfully complete the application

1. Passport's front and back page

2. US Driving License

3. Rround trip Flight itinerary. I booked a refundable ticket and choose tentative dates

4. Airbnb's refundable reservation

5. Digital copy of Passport-style (2"x2") photograph 

6. Recent bank statement

7. Stamped US VISA and supporting documents

8. I-94 copy

9. Address residency proof of address in the US 

For the next step, either you can directly mail all your documents to the nearest Brazil embassy and schedule a in person interview. Or you can use a third party visa consultant service which can do this on your behalf. Brazil embassy has list of visa consultant services listed after you complete your application. Since this was my first time, I contacted American Visa of DC<sup id='fnref:1'><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup> and sent my documents via FedEx. I received my tourist visa within two weeks.
