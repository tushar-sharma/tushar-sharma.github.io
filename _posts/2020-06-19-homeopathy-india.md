<p> I recently came across a Youtube video where Mukesh Batra is recipient of Padma Shri award from the president of India. It’s 4th highest civilian award in India. It’s usually conferred on people for distinguished service to the country. He was awarded for his contribution to homeopathy in India. Alarm bell went off in my head as soon as I heard homeopathy.

As a kid I usually heard about two types of medicine. One was allopathy which is a pejorative term for modern science. It was always blamed for side effects. “Only if you are really sick”, my uncle used to say, “should you take allopathy”.<!-- truncate_here -->

## Allopathy vs Homeopathy
As a kid I usually heard about two types of medicine. One was allopathy which is a pejorative term for modern science. It was always blamed for side effects. “Only if you are really sick”, my uncle used to say, “should you take allopathy”.

Other was alternative medicine, which is an umbrella term for Ayurveda, homeopathy, yoga, acupuncture, etc. “They don’t have any side effects”, I often heard, “they should be recommended first”.

## What’s homeopathy? 

It was developed by Samuel Hahnemann in 1796. During this time modern germ theory of disease was not prevalent. Most scientist believed in miasma theory of disease. Also unconventional methods like bloodletting was also prevalent.  

Homeopathy in a nutshell has two theory 

1. **Like cures Like**: the notion that a disease can be cured by a substance that produces similar symptoms in healthy people


2. **Law of minimum dose** —the notion that the lower the dose of the medication, the greater its effectiveness. Many homeopathic products are so diluted that no molecules of the original substance remain.


## What does the science say? 

None of the claims of homeopathy has been scientifically proven. In fact, homeopathy has been dismissed as quackery, pseudoscientific, placebo, etc. 

Some homeopathic practitioner uses scientific jargon to legitimize homeopathy. "For the first time in the world, we are using homeopathy for genetics"- Mukesh Batra<sup><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>. Such claims are nothing but bunkum.

## No side effects?

One of the myths of Homeopathy is that it has no side effects<sup><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup>. 

A 2012 systematic review of case reports and case series concluded that using certain homeopathic products (such as those containing heavy metals like mercury or iron that are not highly diluted) or replacing an effective conventional treatment with an ineffective homeopathic one can cause adverse effects, some of which may be serious.

The FDA has warned consumers about different products labeled as homeopathic. For example, in 2017 it alerted consumers that some homeopathic teething tablets had excessive amounts of the toxic substance belladonna; in 2015, it warned consumers not to rely on over-the-counter asthma products labeled as homeopathic, because they are not evaluated by the FDA for safety and effectiveness.<sup><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup>

## Conclusion

I always believed there were two system of medicine. Modern medicine & traditional medicine. However, I have realized that there’s only one system of medicine - Medicine that works. 

If an herb in Ayurveda can cures an illness, it becomes part of modern medicine like Sarpagandha is used in treatment of systolic hypertension. Artemisinin inhibits malaria parasite has been part of Chinese Traditional Medicine. Yoga has been demonstrated to increase mental and physical benefits. 


Many countries are discontinuing funding to homeopathy for example France will end reimbursing of homeopathic patient by 2021, Spain in 2018 plans to ban homeopathy, etc. I was surprised to find homeopathy medicine in CVS, a common drugstore in the US. I came across the news that a lawsuit has been filed by the Center for Inquiry (CFI) against this practice<sup><a href='#fn:4' rel='footnote'>4</a></sup>.

India is currently ruled by nationalist right-wing BJP government. Certain promotion of ancient cultures & practices like yoga is welcomed. However too much glorification on past like research on cows, urine, dung, homeopathy, Ayurveda, etc may not be best bet for India to remain competitive in research in 21st century<sup><a href='#fn:5' rel='footnote'>5</a></sup>.
