<p>I  came across a youtube video where Mukesh Batra is receiving a Padma Shri award from the President of India. Padma Shri is a fourth highest prestigious civilian award in India. It’s usually conferred to people for distinguished service to the country. I had no prior knowledge about Batra’s work so I decided to dig more about him.

Mukesh Batra has played a key role in development of homeopathy in India. He claims to use homepathy for genetics. Many famous celebrities & polticians in India are known to endorse or promote him.

I recently came across a Youtube video where Mukesh Batra is recipient of Padma Shri award from the president of India. It’s 4th highest civilian award in India. It’s usually conferred on people for distinguished service to the country. He was awarded for his contribution to homeopathy in India. Alarm bell went off in my head as soon as I heard homeopathy.

As a kid I usually heard about two types of medicine. One was allopathy which is a pejorative term for modern science. It was always blamed for side effects. “Only if you are really sick”, my uncle used to say, “only then you should take allopathy”.

Traditional medicine was an umbrella term for Ayurveda, homeopathy, etc. “They don’t have any side effects”, I often heard, “why not try them first”.

Mukesh Batra has played a key role in promotion of homeopathy in India. He claims to use homeopathy for genetics. Many famous celebrities & politicians in India are known to endorse or promote him.

### What is Homeopathy? 

It was developed by Samuel Hahnemann in 1796 when scientist still believed in miasma theory of disease. It was a time when frequent blood letting was used to cure patient. Homeopathy is based on two theories:

1. **Like cures like** —the notion that a disease can be cured by a substance that produces similar symptoms in healthy people

2. **Law of minimum dose**—the notion that the lower the dose of the medication, the greater its effectiveness. Many homeopathic products are so diluted that no molecules of the original substance remain.

None of these theories of hemeopathy is backed by science. Countless studies have dismissed it as quackery that may have placebo effect. I have met numerous people who swear by their anecdotal experience how effective homeopathy is.

Another common misconception is that homeopathy products have no sideffect[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ijcp.12026]. In 2017, FDA confirms elevated levels of belladonna in certain homeopathic teething products[https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-confirms-elevated-levels-belladonna-certain-homeopathic-teething-products]. 

I was surprised to find homeopathy medicine in CVS, a common drugstore in the US. I came across the news that a lawsuit has been filed by the Center for Inquiry (CFI) against this practice<sup><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>.


Pragya Thakur was elected as member of parliament in India in 2019. She has a controversial past for being a prime accused in Malegaon blasts. However I was also disapointed how she continues to promote homeopathy. Her speech in a nutshell, “Koi bhi pathy hoon paranthu who pathy kabhi bhi buri nahin hothi.” (sic) . Translation, “Whatever pathy it is, no pathy is ever bad”.

Politicans supporting homeopathy is not unique to India. British conservative politician David Tredinnick supports homeopathy & chiropractic.  In the video below, he raises benefits of homeopathy in the UK parliament. However Prime Minster Teresa May replies that it would be best to follow the recommendations of National Health Service (NHS). Simon Stevens, head of NHS, had publicly expressing his "serious concerns about the fundamentally flawed practice of homeopathy".

Indian government has created AYUSH<sup><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> department which focuses on research & development of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy. It has been often criticized for peddling pseudoscience. It suggested homeopathy remedies for prevention of coronavirus infection<sup><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup>.


I think government of India is doing great disservice to Ayurveda by conflating it with Homepathy. Ayurveda is an ancient Indian system of medicine. Sushruta Samhita is an ancient text(1st-millennium BCE) that explains surgical training. Sarpagandha is another Indian herb mentioned in Ayurveda that is used in treatment of of systolic hypertension. 

Not everything in ayurveda is manna. Some medicine of ayurveda have reportedly high lead, mercury or arsenic concentrations. I believe Ayurveda has some useful herbs & treatments. However it needs to embrace mainstream science to allow scrutiny & randomised clinical trials. 

Many countries are discontinuing funding to homeopathy for example France will end reimbursing of homeopathic patient by 2021, Spain in 2018 plans to ban homeopathy, etc. I hope good sense prevails in India to follow suit.
