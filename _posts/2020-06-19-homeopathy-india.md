<p>I  came across a youtube video where Mukesh Batra is receiving a Padma Shri award from the President of India. Padma Shri is a fourth highest prestigious civilian award in India. It’s usually conferred to people for distinguished service to the country. I had no prior knowledge about Batra’s work so I decided to dig more about him.

Homeopathy is pseudoscience. Countless studies have dismissed it as nothing more than placebo. I have met numerous people who swear by their anecdotal experience how effective homeopathy is.


I was surprised to find homeopathy medicine in CVS, a common drugstore in the US. I came across the news that a lawsuit has been filed by the Center for Inquiry (CFI) against this practice<sup><a href='#fn:1' rel='footnote'>1</a></sup>.


Pragya Thakur was elected as member of parliament in India in 2019. She has a controversial past for being a prime accused in Malegaon blasts. However I was also disapointed how she continues to promote homeopathy. Her speech in a nutshell, “Koi bhi pathy hoon paranthu who pathy kabhi bhi buri nahin hothi.” (sic) . Translation, “Whatever pathy it is, no pathy is ever bad”.

Politicans supporting homeopathy is not unique to India. British conservative politician David Tredinnick supports homeopathy & chiropractic.  In the video below, he raises benefits of homeopathy in the UK parliament. However Prime Minster Teresa May replies that it would be best to follow the recommendations of National Health Service (NHS). Simon Stevens, head of NHS, had publicly expressing his "serious concerns about the fundamentally flawed practice of homeopathy".

Indian government has created AYUSH<sup><a href='#fn:2' rel='footnote'>2</a></sup> department which focuses on research & development of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homeopathy. It has been often criticized for peddling pseudoscience. It suggested homeopathy remedies for prevention of coronavirus infection<sup><a href='#fn:3' rel='footnote'>3</a></sup>.


I think government of India is doing great disservice to Ayurveda by conflating it with Homepathy. Ayurveda is an ancient Indian system of medicine. Sushruta Samhita is an ancient text(1st-millennium BCE) that explains surgical training. Sarpagandha is another Indian herb mentioned in Ayurveda that is used in treatment of of systolic hypertension. 

Not everything in ayurveda is manna. Some medicine of ayurveda have reportedly high lead, mercury or arsenic concentrations. I believe Ayurveda has some useful herbs & treatments. However it needs to embrace mainstream science to allow scrutiny & randomised clinical trials. 

However homeopathy is a quackery. For a example mainstream science would take cinchona bark to treat malaria. However homeopathy would take a small substance and repeatedly dilute it with water, alcohol or milk sugar. Homeopathy claims that more dilution creates more potent solution. Science disagrees. The laws of chemistry state that there is a limit to the dilution that can be made without losing the original substance altogether. This limit is called Avogadro’s number (6.023 x 1023). A 30 X diluted solution would not have any memory of the active ingredient. 

Homeopathy was developed by Samuel Hahnemann in 1796 when scientist still believed in miasma theory of disease. It was a time when frequent blood letting was used to cure patient. Many countries are discontinuing funding to homeopathy example France will end reimbursing of homeopathic patient by 2021, Spain in 2018 plans to ban homeopathy, etc. I hope India should also follow suit.
