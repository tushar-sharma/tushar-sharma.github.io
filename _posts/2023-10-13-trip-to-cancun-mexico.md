Snapshot of my travel to Cancun, Mexico.<!-- truncate_here -->

Snapshot of my travel to Cancun, Mexico.

### Arrival

I flew from Charlotte Douglas International Airport (CLT) to Cancun International Airport (CUN) airport on November 22 with American Airline. I reached Cancun at 4.30pm.

I have Iphone 14 which supports eSIM. I already had airola. I purchased Mexican plan before reaching there.

### Table tennis coach

I found Jonathan on [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/jonathan_tapia_/). He gives tabel tennis coaching for $15 per hour. This is much cheaper rate than the United States.

### Tours

I took [volleyball airbnb experience](https://www.airbnb.com/experiences/3578453). Chrispy was so welcoming and he was a constant teacher to the game! The games were fun and competitive and met a lot of local friends. A lot of volleyball being played, amazing people to meet and overall wonderful experience for the value! Would recommend to anyone who wants to enjoy the sun, play a little beach volleyball and meet some new friends.

I also took [ATV adventures](https://www.viator.com/tours/Cozumel/ATV-Ride-to-the-Jade-Cavern/d632-3386P12) in Cozumel...
