I went for lunch at Ilios Crafted Greek Restaurant so I thought I reviewed it. The restaurant is located at 1514 S Church St, Charlotte, NC 28203.

I am familiar with Greek cuisine. I ordered a chicken gyro (traditional) with an option of a side. I choose Chicken soup as a side. They were also an option to add fries on the gyro but that was for another day.

Order service was quick. Gyro was good but the Chicken soup was bit salty for my taste. Quantity was decent enough for a meal. I spent around $13.58 including the tip.

I would return to this restaurnt to try another meal.
