I came across Georgia Purdom who is an American biologist and a young Earth creationist. Now biologist and young earth creationism appears paradoxical. How can you be a biologist and not believe in Darawin's theory of evolution?

Here's a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82j1IqwA6P0) where she is trying to justify how Noah's ark was feasible. She is using scientific jargons and disingenously trying to shape of narrative that Earth is less than 10,000 year old.


She is employeed at Answers in Genesis. It's a far-right Christian apologetics parachurch organization. In their own [website](https://answersingenesis.org/age-of-the-earth/how-old-is-the-earth/) they say 

<blockquote>
When we start our thinking with God's Word, we see that the world is about 6,000 years old. When we rely on man's fallible (and often demonstrably false) dating methods, we can get a confusing range of ages from a few thousand to billions of years, though the vast majority of methods do not give dates even close to billions.

...
  
The age of the earth ultimately comes down to a matter of trust—it's a worldview issue. Will you trust what an all-knowing God says on the subject, or will you trust imperfect man’s assumptions and imaginations about the past that regularly are changing?
