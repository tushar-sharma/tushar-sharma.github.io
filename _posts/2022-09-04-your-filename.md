I was looking for an event to practice table tennis. I found one table tennis event at Greensboro happenning at  Pig Pounder Brewery. I have not acquired taste for alcohol so I skipped the menu and went straight to the two table tennis tables. One table was occupied by kids. Other table was available for us to play table tennis. 

There was a live music at the venue by Banjo Earth Band. Interestingly, the singer of the band travelled to Kashmir, India and composed the song. The song is called Nights in Kashmir. 




2.  There was a live music band called bojo earth. they plaed kashmir song.
