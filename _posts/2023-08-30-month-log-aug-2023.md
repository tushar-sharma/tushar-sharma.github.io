### Rambling 

Google launched [Project IDX](https://idx.dev/), an AI based browser. I have signed up for the waitlist. Will report back if I get the access.

Google also launched [Notebook LM](https://notebooklm.google.com/signup), an AI note taking app. I'm also on the waitlist for the same. Google is launching too many AI products lately.

Came accross this [website](https://stopncii.org/). It lets you submit the original photo and the edited photo, then they will remove the edited photo from all the places on the Internet. I'm not sure how effective this. Need to investigate more.

I am been demoted to last group in table tennis club. I am not able to pratice and it's humilating. I need to pratice more but I've so many other things on my plate.
