I went for lunch with my team at Bang Bang Burgers in Charlotte. It was a bit of a walk from the office, but luckily the weather wasn't hot, so it was a pleasant stroll to the restaurant.<!-- truncate_here -->

I went for lunch with my team at Bang Bang Burgers in Charlotte. It was a bit of a walk from the office, but luckily the weather wasn't hot, so it was a pleasant stroll to the restaurant.

The address is 235 W Tremont Ave #101, Charlotte, NC 28203.

I decided to try their Burger Bowls with Salmon. The bowl was filled with a delightful combination of ingredients. It had mixed greens, crispy bacon, sliced tomatoes, red onion, guacamole, a hard-boiled egg, and sweet potato. The bowl was dressed with a refreshing mix of lemon juice and extra virgin olive oil. As I don't eat red meat, I skipped the pork and focused on enjoying the other delicious flavors in the bowl. The portion was generous, and I felt satisfied after finishing it.

After we finished our lunch and left the restaurant, we started heading back to the office. However, just as we began our journey, it started raining. At first, it was just a light drizzle, and I didn't mind getting a little wet. But as we continued walking, the rain intensified. If we had been more than five minutes late, we would have been caught in a heavy downpour. I ended up getting slightly drenched, but thankfully it wasn't too bad.
