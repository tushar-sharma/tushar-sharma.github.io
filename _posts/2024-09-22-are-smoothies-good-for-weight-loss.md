This morning, I woke up and made a smoothie for myself—a mix of blueberries, raspberries, and milk, with no added sugar. I felt pretty good, thinking, "At least I'm eating healthy!" But then, curiosity got the better of me. Are smoothies really as healthy as they seem?

When you blend fruits, something interesting happens. The natural sugars in the fruit, which are normally trapped inside the cell walls, are released. These are often referred to as "**free sugars**." But what exactly are free sugars? They're sugars that are no longer bound within the structure of the food. In this case, blending breaks open the cells, making the sugar more easily absorbed by your body, which could potentially cause a spike in your blood sugar levels.

Another thing that changes when you blend fruits is the fiber. **Fiber** is the part of fruits (and other plant-based foods) that our bodies don't digest. It helps slow down the absorption of sugars and keeps you feeling full. In whole fruits, the fiber remains intact, creating a natural "barrier" that slows down sugar absorption. But when you blend fruits, the fiber is physically broken down, meaning it doesn’t work as effectively in slowing down digestion.

Smoothies can still be a great option, especially if you're using whole, fresh fruits like I did today. However, it's important to be mindful of portion sizes and the ingredients you're using. If you're adding a lot of sugary ingredients (even natural ones like honey or flavored yogurt), your smoothie might not be as healthy as you think.

A good rule of thumb is: **Eat your fruits and juice your vegetables.** Eating whole fruits ensures you get all the benefits of intact fiber, and juicing vegetables allows you to pack in nutrients without adding too much sugar.
