Dear Vishi, my logs for today.

## Rayman Legends

It's a great game that I've been binge playing. The background music is great and each stage is exciting. 

Cons: 
- You can't play it offline as it requires Ubisoft launcher to connect to internet

Few tips:
- Limit FPS to 58 on steam deck. This made it render better on a TV monitor. 

- If you are using a remote controller, you might need to **Reorder Controller** to give it preference over steams native controller.
