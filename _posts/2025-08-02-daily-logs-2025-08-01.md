Dear Vishi, my logs for today.

## Rayman Legends

It's a great game that I've been binge playing. The background music is great and each stage is exciting. 

Cons: 
- You can't play it offline as it requires Ubisoft launcher to connect to internet

Few tips:
- Limit FPS to 58 on steam deck. This made it render better on a TV monitor. 

- If you are using a remote controller, you might need to **Reorder Controller** to give it preference over steams native controller.

## Windows Tinting

I have a long commute to work. So wanted to tint the windows. First, learnt about VLT. In a nutshell, 35% 
percent vlt means that it should allow 35 percent of light to pass through. Lower vlt means, more dark. However I was more concerned about UV rays then privacy. Also I wanted to tint only the windshield and front side windows to keep the cost down. Here's what I ended doing on my car:

1. **Windshield**: 70% so that's it's not conspicuously obvious

2. **Visor**: 5% vlt

3. **Front Side Windows**: 50% vlt. I could have gone with 35%. However since I am not doing it on all windows, so it kind of looked weird.
