The sun's rays had already crept through my window & drenched my room with light. Sleep taste sweetest when you resist to wake up. It is but with heavy heart that I relinquish my sleep & pull myself toghether. <br>But not today! It was a weekend that bought me few more drops of honey as I extended my sleep while a statue of abstemious Bhudda, which I recently bought, wandered aloud at the petty cumberworld outgrowing in both time & stupidity.

It seems like yesterday when I hit a wall & made a crazy resolution to indulge in meditation. Before some of the readers protest, I dispose with full earnesty that mediation is a very userful transcendental exercise. But Indian, along with genes to eat pani puri & digest spicy food, I also have some false preconceptions. Like billions of Indians, I believe that meditation, like cricket, dancing, acting, etc comes naturally to Indians. I once joked with my American friend on how I would have played for Indian cricket team if not for the engineering. Also I told him that India produces 1.5 million engineers a year which is twice the population of Iceland, which left him gaping at me.

Before I digress more, I should come back to the bed. Yes the abode of eteral happiness. But tranquility was disturbed by one mistake. The crazy resolution had pumped up ideas in my mind. Yesterday I had fallen to one of such idea, to set up my alarm clock. It's a sin, decreed by Gods against setting alarm in the weekend. The chapter 2, verse 2 of sleeping scripture mandates against any temptation to use of unholy alarm clocks. But sometimes infectious displine compels us to use alarm clocks which I did yesterday to set the alarm of 10 AM.

Meditation are often advised in the wee hours of day. My parents have a habit of walking at 5 AM. But such infectious displine was never caught by me. I was saved by vaccination of "laziness" which I received in four year of my college. I urge the goverment to promulgate such vaccination to all and sundry.  


Both arms of the clock had stopped graceously at 10 before the sound filled the room. A slip of hand to snooze and clock raced faster, a minute became a score, while I pressed another "snooze". Before I regain consciousness & pulled myself out of slumber, it was 11 AM. Half of the world was already busy doing chores and I decided it was time to practice meditation. 

I pulled up a meditation lesson by "Ravi Ravi Shankar". His photo with long hair while smiling profusely, instilled unparalled motivation in me. "I could be next Vivekanada", I quipped, though the Bhudda statue in my room chuckled mischeviously. I have seen American do challenging "yoga" while as an Indian I felt the shame to simple task such as sitting cross legs. Since I needed a scapegoat to blame for my flaws, I chose western culture & modernity (A common phrase used India to blame for our woes, though such reasons are as much genuine as my rambling).

The meditation started with nice Sitars. And I really felt enerzised through out the meditation. It was all beautiful and I could feel the inhale & the outhale. After a long time, I sheepishly opened my eye to keep track of the time. It was only eleapsed five mintues while twenty five mintues were left. It seems that the time froze. The clocks were taking revenge on my by dragging slowly & meditaiton felt like a journey. With every minture I grew more unconfortable. It seems my body had lost the capacity to comprehend stillness. And like a sponge I sat, marinating in my restlesness. 

The statue of Bhudda was quiet. It had a contempt for me but also some pity. In midst of meditaton, I felt I was sitting in my car. I revved up the engine and navigated through the familiar streets weaving in and out of traffic. But soon streets were unfamiliar which slowed my car. Like a fool I drove many times across the same street. But I liked the driving with the wind gushing through the window. It was the journey that I liked not the destination. 

The restless of meditation was soon crumbling down under the weight of tranquility. The car reminded me of the charriot that Arjuna drove in Mahabharata, an Indian magnum opus. Like Krishna, a charioteer driving Arjuna in the battle, the car symbolizes human body with the soul behind the steering. 

Though it was a longest half hour meditation for me, I have commited to indulge more in meditation. It means I might have to pick up some vices like waking up quite early and little displine. But I belive my next experience with meditation will be more consistent & frutiful.
