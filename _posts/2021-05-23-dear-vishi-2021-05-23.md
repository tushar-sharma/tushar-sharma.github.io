Today I had coconut water. I drank it from the source itself, the coconut. It saves me from the added sugar & preservative from the packaged coconut bottle available in the shopping mall.

In India, it's easy to find patchy shops on the sideways of the raod selling fresh coconut water. However in the US, I couldnt find any fresh coconut water. Most of the retail sector is very organized in the USA. I only relied upon packaged coconut water.
