Today I had coconut water. I drank it from the source itself, the coconut. It saves me from the added sugar & preservative from the packaged coconut bottle available in the shopping mall.

In India, it's easy to find patchy shops on the road sideways selling fresh coconut water. However in the US, I couldnt find any fresh coconut water. Most of the retail sector is very organized in the USA. I only relied upon packaged coconut water.  


## Time machine 

Have you seen a time machine? There are many movies romanticizing the idea of time machine. Some magical clock allows a person to travel back and forth in the time therby altering the past, present and future. Alas time machine is beyond the capabilities of current human civilization. May be in the future some genius might unravel some secret to time travel. 

However there's one time machine that we can see everyday. It's called the sky. Everything when you stargaze , you are looking into the past. If you recall, light seems instantaneous but has finite speed. Today scientist have calculated its precise value which is 299,798,458 miles per second.

## Prep


### Interviewing.io

I stumbled upon interview prepartion website called [interviewing](https://start.interviewing.io/). I liked it better than [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com). It allows the interviewers to choose their own question.

## Code

I am building a simple pipeline in AWS using step function. So the cloudformation would be something like this

```bash
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: AWS CloudFormation Template to create step function
Resources:
  MyStepFunction:
    Type: AWS::StepFunctions::StateMachine
    Properties:
      StateMachineName: myFirstStepFunction
```

Here, step function is defined under `Resources`. We also need to create definition of the Step function. Step function uses a JSON-based, structured language which would look something like this

```bash
{
    "Comment": "A Hello World example of the Amazon States Language using Pass states",
    "StartAt": "Hello",
    "States": {
      "Hello": {
        "Type": "Wait",
        "Seconds": 10,
        "Next": "World"
      },
      "World": {
        "Type": "Pass",
        "End": true
      }
    }
  }
```

We need to save this file in s3 location like `my-bucket/step-function/myFirstStepFunction.asl.json`

Visually, it looks like this

Also we need to update our cloudformation template like


```bash
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: AWS CloudFormation Template to create step function
Resources:
  MyStepFunction:
    Type: AWS::StepFunctions::StateMachine
    Properties:
      StateMachineName: myFirstStepFunction
      DefinitionS3Location:
        Bucket: mybucket
        Key: step-function/myFirstStepFunction.asl.json

```
