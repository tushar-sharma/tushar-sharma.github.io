Today I had coconut water. I drank it from the source itself, the coconut. It saves me from the added sugar & preservative from the packaged coconut bottle available in the shopping mall.

In India, it's easy to find patchy shops on the road sideways selling fresh coconut water. However in the US, I couldnt find any fresh coconut water. Most of the retail sector is very organized in the USA. I only relied upon packaged coconut water.

### Interviewing.io

I stumbled upon interview prepartion website called [interviewing](https://start.interviewing.io/). I liked it better than [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com). It allows the interviewers to choose their own question.

## Code

I am building a pipeline in AWS using step function. So the cloudformation would be something like this

```bash
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: AWS CloudFormation Template to create step function
Resources:
  MyStepFunction:
    Type: AWS::StepFunctions::StateMachine
    Properties:
      StateMachineName: myFirstStepFunction
```

Here, step function is defined under `Resources`. We also need to create definition of the Step function. Step function uses a JSON-based, structured language. Which would create a simple example like this

```bash
{
    "Comment": "A Hello World example of the Amazon States Language using Pass states",
    "StartAt": "Hello",
    "States": {
      "Hello": {
        "Type": "Wait",
        "Seconds": 10,
        "Next": "World"
      },
      "World": {
        "Type": "Pass",
        "End": true
      }
    }
  }
```

We need to save this file in s3 location like `my-bucket/step-function/myFirstStepFunction.asl.json`


Also we need to update our cloudformation template like


```bash
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Description: AWS CloudFormation Template to create step function
Resources:
  MyStepFunction:
    Type: AWS::StepFunctions::StateMachine
    Properties:
      StateMachineName: myFirstStepFunction
      DefinitionS3Location:
        Bucket: mybucket
        Key: step-function/myFirstStepFunction.asl.json

```
