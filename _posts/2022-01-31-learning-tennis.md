I have started learning tennis in the U.S. Most tennis courts in the States have synthetic turf and are free for public access.<!-- truncate_here -->

I have started learning tennis in the U.S. Most tennis courts in the States have synthetic turf and are free for public access.

Back in India, Badminton is a popular sport. Badminton doesn't require much infrastructure and can be played in any open space at least 20 feet apart. Thought there are dedicated badminton courts in India, much of the sport is played out in open street, ground, or driveway, etc.

I grew up playing badminton. One of my most favourite technique in badminton you can use your full strength to smash the shuttlecock across your opponent.

However badminton skills are not transferable to tennis. Similar smash would crash the tennis ball out of the court. So I have to learn forehand[^forehand] to keep the ball in the court.

Currently my tennis rating is `2.5`[^rating]. Tennis is often dubbed as a sprot for anyone between 4 and 94. Luckily I little younger than 94, so I would continue to learn and play tennis.
