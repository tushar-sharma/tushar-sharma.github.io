Badminton sport has a low learning curve unlike tennis. Even your granny can hit a birdie. I grew up playing badminton but decided to try my luck with tennis. "Playing tennis would be a cakewalk", I thought. However my hubris was soon deflated.<!-- truncate_here -->

Badminton is a game of reflex and agility. One of my most favourite technique in badminton you can use your full strength to smash the shuttlecock across your opponent. Since the shuttlecock is made of feather, you can easily control its trajectory.

However badminton skills are not directly transferable to tennis. On my first day playing tennis, I was hitting tennis ball all over the place.  So I had to learn forehand[^forehand] technique to properly hit the ball.

Currently my tennis rating is `2.5`[^rating]. Tennis is often dubbed as a sport for anyone between 4 and 94 years of age. Luckily I little younger than 94, so I can continue to improve and enjoy game of tennis.
