A day in Marryland

Richu and me stopped at Marryland for rest for our trip from East Providence, RI to Charlotte, NC. 

The apartment was a townhouse. The host allowed us to bring our guinea pigs and a hamster into the house.

For dinner we ordered pickup food from `Sizzling Bombay`. The food was good

1. The chowmein was authentic

2. Momos were okish. 

3. Tom yum soup was good.
