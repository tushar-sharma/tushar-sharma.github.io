If you have a US visa stamped on your passport (H1b visa in my case), you can get Mexican on-arrival visa. 

I arrived at Cancun airport. The immigration was less than 10 minutes. The only question he asked me was how many days is your trip to Mexico. It needs be less than 30 days.

I used my bofa debit card to withdraw some cash. 

There's a ADO bus which you can take to go to downtown cancun. I was going to Merida, Yuchatan. So I had to take two tickets, one for downtown Cancun and then for Merida. 

Merida is almost 5 hours from bus from cancun.

In Merida I took table tennis training at `Club Estyga de Tenis de Mesa` which is located at : 

Unidad Deportiva, Zona Industrial, Francisco de Montejo, 97205 MÃ©rida, Yuc

I contacted two trainers : 

1. ? 

2. ? 

The price was 200 mexican pesos for two hours.
