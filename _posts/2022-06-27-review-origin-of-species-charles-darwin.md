## Day 1

Charles Darwin boarded H.M.S. 'Beagle'. He took a trip to Gal√°pagos Islands in Ecuador.

Most scientists believed before Darwin that species were immutable. It was a radical idea to suggest that we all species are evolved from a common ancestor. In the words of Darwin himself, 
"I am fully convinced that species are not immutable; but that those belonging to what are called the same genera are lineal descendants of some other and generally extinct species..Further, I am convinced that Natural Selection has been the most important, but not the exclusive, means of modification." 

## Why species had variablity? 

"It seems clear that organic beings must be exposed during serveral generations to new conditions to cause any great amount of variation"
