Charles Darwin boarded H.M.S. 'Beagle'.

- Species are not immutable

"I am fully convinced that species are not immutable; but that those belonging to what are called the same genera are lineal descendants of some other and generally extinct species..Further, I am convinced that Natural Selection has been the most important, but not the exclusive, means of modification." - Charles Darwin

Why species had variablity? 
"It seems clear that organic beings must be exposed during serveral generations to new conditions to cause any great amount of variation"
