## Day 1

Charles Darwin boarded H.M.S. 'Beagle'. He took a trip to Gal√°pagos Islands in Ecuador.

Most scientists believed before Darwin that species were immutable. It was a radical idea to suggest that we all species are evolved from a common ancestor. In the words of Darwin himself, 
"I am fully convinced that species are not immutable; but that those belonging to what are called the same genera are lineal descendants of some other and generally extinct species..Further, I am convinced that Natural Selection has been the most important, but not the exclusive, means of modification." 

## Why species had variablity? 

"It seems clear that organic beings must be exposed during serveral generations to new conditions to cause any great amount of variation"

How do we know whether a form should be ranked as a species or a variety? If Neathrethals were alive, were they consider to be another species or just a variation? Neatherthals would have looked same as we humans? First we must understand what we mean with species? Individuals of two species cannot mate and reproduce. For humans and neatherthals, we have evidence of their mating. So definately Neantherthals were not different species. May be a sub species or variation. 

Charles Darwin was at Galapagos islands in Ecuador. Mr Wallace was on islands of Malayan archipelego.
