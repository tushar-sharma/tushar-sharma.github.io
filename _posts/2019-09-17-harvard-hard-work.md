## A New Post
I came across an old speech of Prime minister Modi in 2017 where he quipped, 


<blockquote>
Hard work is more powerful than Harvard
</blockquote>
<br>

It was a veil attack on Amartya Sen, a Harvard educated economist & a Nobel laureate who has been a regular critic of Modi & his policies. Modi had earlier in Nov 2016 announced demonetization of bank notes. Amartya Sen had called the demonetization as a "despotic action that has struck at the root of economy based on trust."

Demonetization was a bold move & its merits are still debated among economist. The move had reduced the country's industrial production and its GDP growth rate[1]. However I am not a economist, I would not dwell into the merits of demonitisation. Notwithstanding I was appalled by the callous statement about our prime minister on demeaning people with esteemed universities.

Amartya Sen has a left leaning idealogies. He is still a Nobel laureate & celebrated for his works on welfare economics. Modi, despite his right wing idealogies, should at least respect the intellect & contribution of people of opposite idealogical spectrum.

I have many friends who are Modi supporter. They should also see the danger of such trivial statements. 

Modi is not a men of letters. He's not a Nehru or Ambedkar or a SarvappalI Rajakrishnan. He was nurtued by RSS. 

During his first tenure as prime minister he had chosen a lawyer, Arun Jaitley to be econmoic minister of India. I have seen people get angry while criticizing indian cricket team. 

I am not a Modi basher but his unwillingness to host press conference, selective sliencde on issue.s makes me worry more. 

I am not a fan of left leaning news portals like caravan, thewire, but it fail to udnertand how modi will fare in economic policies.
