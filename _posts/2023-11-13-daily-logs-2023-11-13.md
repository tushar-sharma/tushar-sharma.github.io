## Git rebase

What's git rebase? Git is a nifty version control tool to manager and organize your files. When working in a team, we create multiple branches so that each developer can work individually Often we need to fetch changes from master branch, this is where `git rebase` is useful. 

```bash
$ git checkout myBranch
$ git rebase origin/master
```

Sometimes this will give errors. You can use mergetool to resolve conflicts. however sometimes, simple solution is to just use original file in master or overwrite it in terms of conflict. 

```bash
$ git checkout myBranch
$ git rebase --stategy recursive -X ours origin/master
$ git rebase --strategy recursive -X theirs origin/master
```

Here, ours means take the master branch in case of conflict. Use `theirs` in case you want to override changes from your branch on top of master in times of conflict. Of course better way is to use a mergetool when in doubt.
