[Is India Still a Democracy?](https://time.com/6305728/voices-of-political-prisoners-from-authoritarian-india/):

This article is written by SUCHITRA VIJAYAN and FRANCESCA RECCHIA.

In this [tweet](https://twitter.com/project_polis/status/1699479293418438660), by the Polis Project, both Suchitra Vijayan and Francesca Recchia is co-writer for the book : `How Long Can the Moon Be Caged? Voices of Indian Political Prisoners`. So Suchitra is the founder and executive director of the Polis Project. 

Another rule of thumb, if a person has written for foreign publications like the Time, then th e person also wrote for the thewire.in and she has written for [the wire](https://m.thewire.in/byline/suchitra-vijayan). 

Now, thewire is a left-wing publication in India.  I'm trying to find pattern how likely is a right wing voices in India get published to foreign publication-s.
