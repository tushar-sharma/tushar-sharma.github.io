## Notes

### Jekyll Build Error

I was building my jekyll site when I encountered this error

```
$ JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build
bundler: failed to load command: jekyll (/Users/USER/.gem/ruby/3.1.2/bin/jekyll)
/Users/USER/.gem/ruby/3.1.2/gems/addressable-2.8.6/lib/addressable/uri.rb:2344:in `to_s': Cannot assemble URI string with ambiguous path: ':' (Addressable::URI::InvalidURIError)
```

I tried to check if there was issue with the gems installed in `Gemfile`. The issue turned out to be rather silly. On my terminal , there was a file with filename as `:`. Colons as filename are prohibited in the Windows, as they conflict with drive letter naming convention (C:). However there's no such restriction on Linux/Mac.
