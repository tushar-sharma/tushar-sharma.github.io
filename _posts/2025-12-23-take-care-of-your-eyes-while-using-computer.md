Spending long hours in front of a computer screen is part of my daily routine, and over time, I've noticed the strain it puts on my eyes. Blue light from displays can disrupt sleep and cause discomfort, but there are practical ways to mitigate this. Here's what I've learned and implemented.<!-- truncate_here -->

## Understanding Blue Light

Computer screens emit blue light, a high-energy visible (HEV) light that helps regulate alertness and circadian rhythm during the day. At night, excessive exposure can suppress melatonin, making it harder to fall asleep and reducing sleep quality. Prolonged exposure also contributes to digital eye strain, which can manifest as:

* Dry or irritated eyes
* Headaches
* Blurred or unfocused vision
* A general sense of visual fatigue

## Follow the 20-20-20 Rule

For every 20 minutes of screen time, look at something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. This gives your eyes a break and helps reduce strain. I set a timer on my phone to remind me.

## Use Software to Reduce Blue Light

Apps like **f.lux** automatically adjust your screen's color temperature based on the time of day, reducing blue light in the evening.

## macOS-Specific Tweaks

You can enable **Night Shift** in `System Settings > Displays`. This built-in feature helps reduce blue light by warming screen colors in the evening.

On Apple Silicon Macs, macOS uses temporal dithering to simulate more colors. This may cause subtle eye fatigue over long sessions. More details on this are [here]({{ root_url }}/blog/stillcolors-in-mac).

Additionally, you can enable [Screen Distance](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/turn-on-screen-distance-mchle20721bd/mac), a macOS feature that alerts you if you sit too close to the screen for extended periods.

## Consider Blue Light Blocking Glasses

Wearing glasses with blue light filters can block a significant portion of HEV light. If you have a doctor's prescription, you can use your HSA to purchase them.

## Try an E-Ink Monitor

Consider an **e-ink** monitor as a second display, like the **DASUNG 13.3" E-ink Monitor (Paperlike HD-F)**. It connects via USB-C and feels like a Kindle for your computer—great for text-heavy work without blue light.

## Final Thoughts

Eye health is cumulative, so small changes add up. Start with the 20-20-20 rule and software adjustments—they're free and effective. If symptoms persist, consult an eye doctor.
