The first google result when I typed "Kerala Story" movie was a link from [CNN article](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/23/india/indian-film-kerala-story-controversy-intl-hnk/index.html). The headline says "The Kerala Story’ is a box office hit in India. It also vilifies Muslims, critics say". 

It's written by [Rhea Mogul](https://twitter.com/rheamogul). I searched her previous article on previous controversial movie like Kashmir Files. It had a predictable headline  as [India’s latest box office smash ‘The Kashmir Files’ exposes deepening religious divides

Who are these critics? She quotes people like Nitasha Kaul. In her own words, Nitasha Kaul say, "IOK ('India occupied Kashmir', called ‘Jammu and Kashmir’, including ‘Ladakh’, in India) has never been an indisputable part of India.
