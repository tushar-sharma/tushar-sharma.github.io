Type "Kerala Story" in google. First link is from a news article from [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/23/india/indian-film-kerala-story-controversy-intl-hnk/index.html). It's written by [Rhea Mogul](https://twitter.com/rheamogul). 


The headline says "The Kerala Story’ is a box office hit in India. It also vilifies Muslims, critics say". 

She quotes [Debasish Roy Chowdhury](https://twitter.com/Planet_Deb). Both are located in Hong Kong.

In that article, she quotes opinion of Nitasha Kaul. In her own words, "IOK (‘India occupied Kashmir’, called ‘Jammu and Kashmir’, including ‘Ladakh’, in India) has never been an indisputable part of India.
