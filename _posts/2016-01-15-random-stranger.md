I was once traveling in an Indian bus. Amid loud noises & nudging elbows, I somehow managed to grab a seat. Securing a seat is an achievement in Indian buses which often leads to resentful eyes. However Indian genes has made me immune to both claustrophobia & judgment.

The roads in Indian city are often cluttered with vehicles. The `not so wide roads` are packed with buses and cars. Sometimes this traffic overflows the pavements leading to the resentment of the pedestrians. However pedestrians in India are usually second class citizen. They are always honked at by the vehicles owners who drive the roads in privilege.<!-- truncate_here -->

It was one of those days when I found myself catching the same bus which I always took for my job. Everything was same; crowd, noises, radio stations, street dogs, wandering cows and even the loud conductor. Often the traffic was clogged, which forced the buses to move slower than the pedestrians. The scortching sun made the debut on the wrong day; people were clubbed together in the bus, sweating profusely, with the dust sweeping across the window blocking our nostrils thus saving us from the odour of our fellow passenger. As the bus was moving like a snail, I wondered if I would grow old in this traffic. I even imagined myself getting married and dying in the bus. 


When you have abundant time, your mind begins to play tricks on you. I tried albeit unsuccessfully listening to radio station but the excruciating pain of the senseless `Bollywood` songs made me quit. I cursed myself for not subscribing to `3G` connection which left me in the bus without water & fast internet. `2G` internet works only for those in India who are content with messaging their beloved usually other than family. However I am similar to Helena in `A Midsummer Night's Dream` with not much numbers in the phone to fiddle with.

With the looming danger of hallucination, I began crunching numbers. How much is `327 X 42`. Seven times two is eight, and two times two is four but I forgot the pervious value. How much is the total? Twenty two said a loud voice. I shook my head as it can't be that less. But as my sense prevailed, I panicked fearing if I had thought loudly enough for everyone to hear. `"Sir, Twenty Two change?", said the conductor`. I took my change quickly,  partly relieved as the laws of the physics were not broken and I could still think quietly.

A fine gentleman was sitting in front of me. He was typing frantically on his laptop absored in deep <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samadhi" target="_blank">smadhi</a>. He occasionally slipped open his blackberry phone, a rarity on this day. He spoke `IT`, a common language usually spoken by Indian graduates who could not change their carreer before their marriagable age. Beside him sat a tired man, who occasionally made his shoulders rest on the fine gentleman. However after much discomfort, the fine gentleman exchanged some `not so fine` pleasantries which lead to the conductor to intervene.

One welcome change I have witnessed in India is the presence of female conductors. I also hope that more women could drive buses. This would increase securities for women in the country. However driving in India is not trivial. People require highly sophisticated skills which includes inter alia, ability to drive in zigzag manner on any roads, perform manuvouer to escape potholes, honk relentlessly every time, engage in fight with anyone who you believed is driving wrong. Two-wheeler are given further privilege to drive on the footpath lest the roads are too much crowded. Zebra crossing is often vestigial and pedestrians use their fundamental right to cross the roads at their will.

Amid all my rambling, I forgot my protogonist, a random stranger. By chance, he was also travelling with me in the same bus. However we exchanged no words. He was sitting beside a beautiful girl, who adjusted her hair after every minute. The monotonous bus with fuming heat had only single attraction.

My upbringing with `bollywood movies` gave me unearthly ideas which defied Newtons equation. I began interweaving story in which some miscreants would break into the bus, attack the girl, and I gallantly saved her. After I penned my imaginary script, I reckon a less risky approach would be to just simply say `hi`. However random strangers usually don't greet others in India espically girls. With a sigh, a opened my phone and began playing `Candy Crush`. (Later on lots of my friends in Facebook blocked me because I sent them `Crandy Crush` request)

But with the usual distraction, I noticed my random stranger. He was about my age. Was mostly in deep thought, smiled very little. He glanced at me occasionally, arousing my curiousity. He wore nicely formals carrying a bag. His shoes were worn out and his looks had fatigue. His eyes met mine more than once and it seems they spoke. And it seems the surrounding around me grew dimmer until I could feel only his presense in the bus. 

The other day I was reading about `Qutantum Physics`. Bizzare events happens in quantum physics scientist says. Atom could be superposition which means it could be at two places at once. Time often slows down when you move closer to the speed of light. Electrons communciates at wide distances almost instantly. However sometimes you experience quantum physics in your macro life. When you see your own reflection sitting in front of you. And your heart beats faster when you realise that your reflection is real. I stood motionless when I saw the radom stranger was nothing but my own reflection. It was me. My life was unfolding before me. 

I wanted to wake up from this dream. Usually dreams are chaotic with little sense. I thought such `cinematic effects` can't be real.The beautiful girl was absent from her seat. Such fuzziness is common in a dream. With this reassurance, I went ahead and sat beside my random stranger. `"No body gets harmed in dream?", I thought. "How about I exchange some words with him?". 

I was facing him or he was facing me. The North and South had lost their distinction. And the words were never said for they were not needed. And and time came to a halt and I was hugging my random stranger. It had been some time for someone to hug me. And my eyes were moist but less heavy. And the random stranger was smiling. 

Heavy bumps are often advised by doctors to wake people from dreams. Luckily I woke up just in time before my destination. I stood up & offered my seat to a lady, who thanked with her large smile, eclipsed by her protruding gold tooth. Was it a dream? I began scouring my random stranger. But he was gone. I knew where he had gone. It has been a long time since I had been away from my home. Soon my stop came and I alighted from the bus and called my mom.
