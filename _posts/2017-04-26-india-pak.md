On a brisk day, I was carpooling with my manager. Amidst the roaring traffic, was the familiar melodious voice on the radio. We have grown accustomed to the RJ who played songs that was music to our ears. As my manager revved up the engine, with the occasional drip in audio of the AM, often we broke into conversation.

Amartya Sen in his book, The Argumentative Indian, has argued the Indians are inherently loquacious. True to the argumentative traditions, our conversation percolated through the porous soil of sports into the sedimentary rocks of politics while amassing lump of Bollywood, music, economics, etc along the way. While an old classic Bollywood song played on the radio and I hymned along, dragging our conversation to halt. I gazed out of the window, many sign posts passed by, most of them visibly crestfallen like me.<!-- truncate_here -->

Recently I stumble upon news of lynching of twenty-three year old student in Pakistan a vigilante mob for allegedly “publishing blasphemous content online”. In other news, Pakistans’s Punjab Food Authority (PFA) had seized a large amount of suspected pig meat (pork) during a raid conducted near Lahore Railway Station. Pork is considered “haram” in Islam & thus is forbidden in Pakistan which has predominantly Muslim population.

Lately I am quite perturbed by the surge in cow vigilantism in India. Recently sixty-year old Sabir Ali & his nomadic family, was attacked by a frenzied mob on allegation of cow smuggling. Also in another incident, Indian police in Haryana has been inspecting biryanis for forbidden beef. Cow is consider holy for majority of Hindus & beef is illegal in many Indian states.

It is easy to draw parallel between India & Pakistan. Pahlaj Nihalani, Chairman of India’s Central Board of Film, could easily find a comparable job in Pakistan’s censor board. Replace “beef” with “pork”, Pakistan’s [blasphemy laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy_law_in_Pakistan) with [295 A of Indian Penal code](https://indiankanoon.org/doc/1803184/), similar common disdain for LGBT community, India exudes many similarities like Pakistan.

"However India & Pakistan continue to be arch enemies & have fought multiple wars sometimes escalating threat to a nuclear flashpoint."

Frenzy mob running amok is a symptom of lawlessness which is common occurrence in a banana republic. India could learn from her adversary, Pakistan, of the consequences of not separating religion and state. Though Pakistan is more vulnerable to radicalization thanks to Pakistan’s former dictator Zia-ul-Haq’s Islamization, India walks a tightrope with her feet on rope of a liberal secular democracy  while holding pole of religious fundamentalism.
