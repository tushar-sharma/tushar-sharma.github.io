Dear Vishi, this is my weekly logs from Nov 18 to 24, 2024.

## Snapshot of my habits

<br/><br/>

## Sunday Musing 

### Scroll to Bottom of Google sheets

I despise having to scroll to bottom of the Google Sheet with large entries. Go to `Extentions->Apps Script` and add this to the `Code.gs` file 

```gs
function onOpen() {
    let ss = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
    let sheet = ss.getActiveSheet();
    sheet.setActiveRange(sheet.getRange(sheet.getLastRow(),1));
}
```

### Bangladesh Hindus

This is what Donald Trump tweeted on Diwali before US elections

Bangladesh has seen a recent ousting of their prime minister Sheikh Hasina who [fled to India](https://thediplomat.com/2024/08/violence-in-bangladesh-after-hasinas-ouster-stirs-fear-among-hindu-minority/). It's interesting that Kamala Harris tweeted no such thing on Bangladesh's Hindus. However, Tulsi Gabbard was more vocal on her tweet on Bangladesh

## Saturday Musing

### Suprress stdout for commands in Makefile

Let's say I've a Makefile

```
build:
	./gradlew clean build
```

If I simply run, I can see commands executed by Makefile

```bash
$ make build
./gradlew clean build
```

However I can suppress command using 

```bash
$ make -s build
```

### Skipping test in JUnit

Skip a test during the build like

```java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Disabled;

@Disabled 
public class AppTest {

}
```

## Thursday Musing

### Enable 2FA for Chase

Default **2FA** for Chase has only phone options. However if you are outside the U.S., you mostly rely on email for authentication. Go to [Chase 2FA](https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.chase.com%2Fweb%2Fauth%2Fdashboard%23%2Fdashboard%2FmyDevices%2FauthSecurity%2FtwoFactorAuthentication) and select email
