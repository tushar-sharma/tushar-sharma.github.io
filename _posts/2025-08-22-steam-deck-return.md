Recently, my Steam Deck suddenly developed a display glitch — black screen of death. There was no physical damage or liquid spills. Luckily, the Steam Deck comes with a one-year warranty, and I was still covered with two months remaining.<!-- truncate_here -->

Recently, my Steam Deck suddenly developed a display issue—the screen stayed completely black even though the device powered on and I could hear sound. There was no physical damage or signs of impact. Fortunately, the Steam Deck comes with a one-year warranty, and I was still covered with two months remaining.

My Steam Deck has suddenly stopped displaying anything on the screen. The device powers on (I can see the power light, and I sometimes hear sound), but there is no display output. The screen remains completely black from startup.

There is no broken glass, visible damage, or drops that could have caused this. It happened suddenly during normal use.

Could you please advise on the next steps to troubleshoot or repair?

They asked me to try troubleshooting steps, like getting into BIOS mode and making sure the fan was working, etc.

## Step 2: RMA Approval and Instructions

<ul class="chatlist ">
<li class="shared received">
Hello,<br>

Thanks for the prompt response and confirming. <br>

Based on the information you have provided, we believe it is unlikely that the current issue reflects a problem with this device as it was delivered to you. It may instead be related to your particular use of the product. Regardless, we would like to offer complimentary service as a gesture of goodwill. This will not affect your remaining warranty coverage, but downtime related to the RMA process will be considered when evaluating future warranty claims. Please note that if you encounter additional issues in the future, we may request an opportunity to evaluate the device before deciding how to proceed.<br>

Steam will send you an email containing two documents - an RMA instruction sheet and a pre-paid shipping label. Please allow 24 hours for the email to be prepared and sent.

You will receive an email notification when we've confirmed receipt of the package. Once your device has been received it will be inspected and evaluated for repair. If we're able to repair it, we'll do so and return the original device to you. The inspection and repair process normally takes 5-7 days after receipt. If we're unable to repair any in-warranty issue, you may be sent a replacement device instead.

Use the instructions below to prepare your return. Please review our return packaging guide to ensure your hardware remains safe in transit.

    Remove any items that were not included with your original purchase if possible, such as microSD cards, screen protectors, or third party components. In the event that we are unable to complete your repair and need to send you a new device, these items will not be returned to you. Valve is not responsible for damage that occurs to additional items during the repair process.
    If your device is functional, back up your game installs and any other data you'd like to keep via a microSD card or another external storage device (Valve is not responsible for loss of any data left on your device). Then perform a factory reset on your device by pressing the Steam button and going to Settings > System > Reset to factory state.
        Note: Certain data may still be recoverable from your device after the factory reset. Your Steam Deck's SSD will be separately sanitized when it is received by our team. However, if your Steam Deck should hold any sensitive information, we recommend that you create a recovery USB key by following these instructions and use the “Reimage Steam Deck” option to separately sanitize your Steam Deck's SSD.
    Print your RMA instruction sheet.
    Print the shipping label and place it on the exterior of the box.
    Include the following items inside the box:
        RMA instruction sheet, bar code up.
        Steam Deck with serial number FYZZ43402EF6, placed inside original carrying case.
        You should only include your PSU if you are returning your device for a charging issue. Otherwise, please keep it with you.

Failure to follow these instructions may cause processing delays. You may be asked to pay any additional shipping costs if we require additional items from you to consider your return complete.<br>

Here’s an article on how to [pack your Steam Deck](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/307F-A625-1F33-3247) for return.

**Checklist:**
- Remove all accessories not included with the original purchase.
- Back up your data and perform a factory reset if possible.
- Print and include the RMA instruction sheet.
- Attach the shipping label to the box.
- Pack the Steam Deck securely in its original case.
