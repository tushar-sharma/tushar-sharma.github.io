kopi luwak is the most expensive coffee in the world. It's made from coffee beans that have been partially digested and excreted by the Indonesian palm civet

It's known for its unique taste, which is notable for its lack of bitterness and acidity. However it's also controversial.

Civets are typically snatched from their homes and life in the wild to be imprisoned alone in tiny, barren cages. There have been many complaints from international concerns, as well as journalistic programs regarding animal cruelty in these coffee farms.

In Bali on my way to Kechak dance at Uluwatu temple, my tour stopped at plantation for tasting coffee.
