I went to table tennis league today. I am still stuck at last group. I had few nice serves but made too **unforced errors**.

### TreeMap in Java

Yesterday I solved a problem using `TreeMap`. I wanted to get myself better understand how to use `TreeMap`. 

### Food 

For lunch I ate Chipotle. My usual: bowl with no rice, both beans, chicken, fajitas, tomatoes, corn, guac, no lettuce. 

For dinner, I made noodles with Capsicum and tomatoes. I spoilt myself with icecream. Also had some grapes and banana.
