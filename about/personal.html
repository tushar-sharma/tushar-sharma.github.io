<p>The universe is 13.798 billion years old since the Big Bang. Our tiny blue planet floates around the Sun at 100,000 km/hr. Completely oblivious of the gigantic universe in a tiny valley of Dehradun, I was born. Since my memory was still <i>under construction</i>, I had to believe what my parents told me that this is me.

My nomenclature was done by my mosi <a href="#">[1]</a> and hence I was called Tushar. I was fortunate enough to escape the pangs of poverty or the ugly side of life. In fact much of my childhood had been joie de vivre. Often my relatives recollect memory of me as a scamp always ready to scoot away into the wild.

<p> While growing up I struggled with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp" target="_blank">lisp</a> yet I hardly felt any trepidation because of it. I even joined music choir at school though I sucked. Mostly I reminisce old days when my friends use to suggest me remedies which included from eating chillies to some bizarre tips like keeping the spoon in the mouth at a particular orientation.

I am a computer hobbyist. My infatuation with computer began at my sophomore years at college. I am an ardent follower of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS). I advocate internet freedom and criticize acts like section 66A of Indian Information technology, SOPA, PIPA, etc. Governments capitalize on pubic fear to prosecute the innocents like Aaron Swartz [<a href="#2">2</a>] and the Mumbai girls who were arrested for liking the facebook post [<a href="#3">3</a>].

<p>The grace of the majestic sun, the eloquence of the night accompanied by nomadic clouds, different people interwoven in their own unique story, with vibrant flora and fauna surrounded with magnificent cosmos makes me recall an old Sanskrit phrase of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam [<a href="#4">4</a>] which means the whole universe is one whole family.
</p>

<p>The ship of my life is yet to reach its shore...in the midst of sea of life, an old song often comes to my mind, "Que Sera Sera...Whatever Will Be, Will Be. The future's not ours to be. Que Sera Sera."[<a href="#5">5</a>]</p>
