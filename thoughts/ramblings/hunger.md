# Hunger

Usually feel hungry around 12 am. I decided to read the science behind hunger.

It seems that two hormones are responsible for hunger: leptin & ghrelin. After much inactivity, level of leptin  falls which leads to increase in level of ghrelin, hunger hormone. Need to lear more about it . Seems interesting.
