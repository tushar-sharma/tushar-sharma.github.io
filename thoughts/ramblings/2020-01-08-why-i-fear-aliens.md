## why i fear aliens

I was pretty late in the picture. I was born already late exactly 13.6 billion year old. Thats how odl the universe is. Dinasours , the huge monster, which ruled the earth, have been wiped by a mysterious meteors. How do we know this. ? Universe is pretty scary. What stops it happening again? 

I was born in India into a Hindu family as a boy. This biological accident influenced my color, caste , creed , religion, sex, etc. 

Humans share 99 % their DNA wiht each other. there are like 3 billion base paris of DNA. Every human only differs about 0.6 % of them. (like 20 million base pairs). 

So a Hindu, Muslim, Jew, athiest, etc. have the same 99% DNA. 

interestingly FSB are scary? 

chimpangee 96% dna shared by humans
cat 90% 
mice 85% (that's why lots of research happens on mice). no animal rights 
banana 60% dna same
