<h2 class="entry-title">My Games</h2>
    
<p>The most intimidating as well as fulfilling part of programming is building games. I believe that programming can be best taught by the sheer inspiration of designing games. These games (or snippets of code) does not showcase ingeniousness or bleeding edge technology but rather my own effort to commence my odysseys in game development. Hope you'll like it !</p>
