<h3>About</h3>
<p>
  Hi! I'm a undergraduate student in Electronics & Communication from JUIT. This is my nest where I incubate my thoughts which I hope would someday hatch into something meaningful. <!--- I belive in an old Sanskrit adage from Bhagvatgita, <i>"कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन। मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोस्त्वकर्मणि॥".</i>(<u>English translation</u> -Your right is to work only, But never to its fruits; Let not the fruits of action be thy motive, Nor let thy attachment be to inaction). -->

  I am a developer and a computer hobbyist. I am constantly trying to make stuffs. Some of the projects I have worked on are either a part of my academics, employment or a residue of my spare time.

<h3>Blog</h3>
<p>
  As part of the planet, I feel inclined to share my opinion on everything that affects me both directly and indirectly. Most of my rambling is about programming, poetry, world and anything that steals my attention. Let me know what you think about what I think.
