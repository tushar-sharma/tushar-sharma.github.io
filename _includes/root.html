<h3>About</h3>
<p>
  Hi! I've pursued undergraduation in Electronics & Communication from <a href="http://juit.ac.in" target="_blank">JUIT</a>. Recently I pursued Senior Certificate programme from <a href="http://ufl.edu" target="_blank">University of Florida</a>. This is my nest where I incubate my thoughts which I hope would someday hatch into something meaningful.<br>
</p>
<p>
  I am a <a href="/computer">computer hobbyist</a>. I also harbor interest in literature. Here are some of my <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4658439-tushar-sharma" target="_blank">interests</a>. Occasionally I like to dip my pen into poetry. Here are some of my <a href="http://poetry.com/users/347898" target="_blank">poems</a>.

 <!--- I belive in an old Sanskrit adage from Bhagvatgita, <i>"कर्मण्येवाधिकारस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन। मा कर्मफलहेतुर्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोस्त्वकर्मणि॥".</i>(<u>English translation</u> -Your right is to work only, But never to its fruits; Let not the fruits of action be thy motive, Nor let thy attachment be to inaction). -->

  As part of the planet, I feel inclined to share my opinion on everything that affects me both directly and indirectly. Most of my rambling revolves around world of tech, literature or anything that steals my attention. Feel free to drop a line.
