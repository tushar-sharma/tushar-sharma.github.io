<h3>Howdy, stranger!</h3>
<p>
  Welcome to <i>Mono Dew</i>, my digital footprint. This is my nest where I incubate my thoughts that I hope would someday hatch into something meaningful.
</p>

<p>I am <i>Tushar Sharma</i>. I am a avid blogger and voracious reader. I am passionate about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank">FOSS</a>, occasionally like to dip my pen into <a href="http://poetry.com/users/347898" target="_blank">poetry</a><!--, enjoy <a href="http://www.flickr.com/people/tushoxy/" target="_blank">travelling</a> --> and also harbour interest in literature. Also I spend my time solving interesting <a href="http://community.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&cr=22898372" target="_blank">problems</a> and compiling <a href="http://quotabl.es/users/tsh/quotes" target="_blank">quotes</a> of people that matter.
