        <p>Recently, my roommate, had his job contract terminated. He found a new job in another city which meant I had to hunt for a new roommate. So I quickly posted an ad on Sulekha<sup id="fnref:sulekha" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:sulekha" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, a popular website in USA among Indians.</p>
        <p>A month ago I had stumbled upon an old friend in a private birthday bash. He was raving about a rent scam. More than thousands of dollars were siphoned off his account. Barring some sympathy, I paid little heed to his story. Little did I know I would almost fell for a similar scam.</p>

        <h3 id="how-the-scam-works">How the scam works?</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The buyer uses a cashier's check or money order. They explain that this is their only option for payment.</li>
          <li>The seller or recipient gets a check for more than they asked for.</li>
          <li>The seller is supposed to send the extra money back to the buyer or to a "helper"</li>
        </ol>
        <p>But's here's the catch. After you deposit the fradulent cheque in the bank, the bank must provide you with the cash to withdraw within 2 business days. But it can take sometimes take more than four days for banks to verify if the cheque is genuine<sup id="fnref:bank" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:bank" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>.</p>
        <p>Once the bank finds out the cheque is bogus, it reverses the amount. In the meantime, if you had already transferred money to someone else, the money is lost. And now you also owe bank that transferred amount.</p>
        <p>So far I have realized that this was a scamster. But I wanted to have some fun 😉.</p>

But I have personally known many smart people falling to many scams like rent scam, USCIS scam, 911 scam, etc. Luckily I had met an old friend a month ago who had warned me about this scam.</p>
